In 1843, the people of Illinois met for the first nominating convention of the Whig party, to nominate someone for Congress. Abraham Lincoln and two others were front runners going into the convention. But after the first ballot it became clear Lincoln would not win. So the supporters of his opponent, Edward Baker, asked Lincoln to withdraw and support Baker, so as to have a unified front. He did so.

But the group also wanted Lincoln to become chairman of the Sangamon County delegation. So, Lincoln arrived at the convention a candidate for Congress, and left the chairman of a delegation pledged to his opponent.

He wrote his friend:

> In getting Baker the nomination, I shall be fixed a good deal like a fellow who is made a groomsman to a man who has cut him out and is marrying his own dear gal.

From: A. Lincoln by Ronald C. White, Jr.
