        I&#39;m a professional video editor and designer with four years of
        social media experience. I have a degree in Digital Media and Design
        from Southeastern University. I&#39;m studying to get my Masters in
        English and Creative Writing and currently work for 
        <a href="https://fs.blog/">Farnam Street</a>. I also 
        <a href="https://www.dltn.io/writing">write online</a>
         and share interesting quotes and ideas on 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/dltnio">Twitter</a>. I love words, books,
        and ideas. I have a dream of designing old, out-of-print books and
        editing a literary magazine. I&#39;m curious about why things are the
        way that they are. Sayings, names, standards, rules; there&#39;s often a
        fascinating backstory behind them all. I like to learn those stories and
        share them with others.

          I&#39;m the Senior Digital Creator at 
          <a href="https://fs.blog/">Farnam Street</a>. I spend most of my time
          making videos for and operating our 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtTf_uKt0Itd0NG7txrwXA">
            podcast&#39;s YouTube channel
          </a>
          . When I&#39;m not doing that, I work on 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zt6qRTmN0">
            writing scripts and editing videos
          </a>
           from our extensive blog content. I also run the social accounts for

          When I&#39;m not working, I&#39;m either reading 
          <a href="https://www.dltn.io/notes">an interesting book</a>

          Every Friday, I send a weekly newsletter with lessons I learn from
          books. You can sign up

          I used to make

          put that on pause for now.

        <li>
          Away from my computer or a book, I either play golf, watch golf, run,
          or hang out with friends and family. My main leisure activities are
          golf and running.
        </li>
        <li>
          I realized lately I love to work out like I&#39;m in prison (my friend
          Ryan Burns used that description of himself and I loved it). I run,
          use TRX bands in my office, do push ups, some ab workouts, and a
          stretching routine every morning. I love running because I sweat and
          when I sweat I think better. I also think it&#39;s the best way to
          increase your mental discipline. As Seneca said, &quot;We treat the
          body rigorously so that it may not be disobedient to the mind&quot;.

        Not so short bio I try to understand how things work and explain them to
        other people. This site is is a record of my becoming of a person as I
        explore the intellectual, creative, philosophical, and spiritual
        questions in this world through extensive research of literature -- both
        young and old. A private journey made public in seek of the one true
        question we all ask at some point: who am I and what is all this?
        Whenever I can refer to wisdom from those who lived before me, I do. The
        following quote comes from Will Durant in The Map of Human Character and
        was the first time I was able to assign words to the inner motivation
        that drives me -- how can we best make sense of everything in the world?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Therefore I feel that we of this generation give too much time to news
          about the transient present, too little to the living past. We are
          choked with news, and starved of history. We know a thousand items
          about the day or yesterday, we learn the events and troubles and
          heartbreaks of a hundred peoples, the policies and pretensions of a
          dozen capitals, the victories and defeats of causes, armies, athletic
          teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how, without history, can we understand these events, discriminate
          their significance, sift out the large from the small, see the basic
          currents underlying surface movements and changes, and foresee the
          result sufficiently to guard against fatal error or the souring of
          unreasonable hopes?&quot;
        </p>

        The legacy I hope to leave behind is similar to that of Albert
        Einstein&#39;s. Not his groundbreaking theories, but his curiosity and
        humility. After his death, The New York Times wrote this: Man stands on
        this diminutive earth, gazes at the myriad of stars and upon billowing
        ocean and tossing trees–and wonders. What does it all mean? How did it
        come about? The most thoughtful wonderer who appeared among us in three
        centuries has passed on in the person of Albert Einstein.

          &quot;The most thoughtful wonderer.&quot; I love that. I hope those
          words are used to describe me one day.
