      <p>
        I'm a professional video editor and designer, working on podcasts,
        YouTube, and social media. I hold a degree in Digital Media and Design
        from Southeastern University and am currently pursuing my Masters in
        English and Creative Writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I work for <a href="https://fs.blog/">Farnam Street</a>. In
        addition to my work there, I also
        <a href="https://www.dltn.io/writing"> write online</a> and share
        interesting quotes and ideas on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/dltnio"> Twitter</a>. I have a profound
        love for words, books, and ideas. When I'm not working or running,
        you'll find me reading or writing. My favorite literary genre is
        narrative non-fiction; I greatly admire David McCullough for his
        remarkable work. He's my hero.
      </p>
      <p>
        While my current focus is on video and digital media, my ultimate
        aspiration is to transition into the world of publishing, where I can
        indulge in reading, writing, and editing.
      </p>

      <h3>For Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am the Senior Digital Creator at{" "}
          <a href="https://fs.blog/">Farnam Street</a>. My primary
          responsibilities include creating videos for and managing our{" "}
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtTf_uKt0Itd0NG7txrwXA">
            podcast's YouTube channel
          </a>
          . Additionally, I write scripts and edit videos using our vast blog
          content. I also oversee the social media accounts for{" "}
          <a href="https://twitter.com/farnamstreet">Farnam Street</a> and
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tkppodcast/">
            The Knowledge Project
          </a>
          . I also manage the bi-weekly production and release of new podcast
          episodes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For Side Projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          During my leisure time, you'll find men{" "}
          <a href="https://www.dltn.io/notes">reading</a>
          or <a href="https://github.com/dmabery">coding</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every Friday, I send out a weekly newsletter sharing valuable lessons
          I learn from books. You can sign up
          <a href="https://www.dltn.io/221b"> here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          I used to create{" "}
          <a href="https://youtube.com/@dltnio">videos on YouTube</a>, but for
          now, I've put that on pause.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For Fun</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When I'm not indulging in books or working, you can find me playing
          golf, watching golf, running, or spending quality time with friends
          and family. Golf and running are my main leisure activities, apart
          from reading.
        </li>
        <li>
          I realized lately I love to work out like I'm in prison (my friend
          Ryan Burns used that description of himself and I loved it). I run,
          use TRX bands in my office, do push ups, some ab workouts, and a
          stretching routine every morning. I love running because I sweat and
          when I sweat I think better. I also think it's the best way to
          increase your mental discipline. As Seneca said, "We treat the body
          rigorously so that it may not be disobedient to the mind".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Not so short bio</h3>
      <p>
        I try to understand how things work and explain them to other people.
        This site is is a record of my becoming of a person as I explore the
        intellectual, creative, philosophical, and spiritual questions in this
        world through extensive research of literature -- both young and old. A
        private journey made public in seek of the one true question we all ask
        at some point:Â who am I and what is all this? Whenever I can refer to
        wisdom from those who lived before me, I do. The following quote comes
        from Will Durant inÂ The Map of Human CharacterÂ and was the first time I
        was able to assign words to the inner motivation that drives me --Â how
        can we best make sense of everything in the world?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Therefore I feel that we of this generation give too much time to news
          about the transient present, too little to the living past.Â We are
          choked with news, and starved of history.Â We know a thousand items
          about the day or yesterday, we learn the events and troubles and
          heartbreaks of a hundred peoples, the policies and pretensions of a
          dozen capitals, the victories and defeats of causes, armies, athletic
          teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how, without history, can we understand these events, discriminate
          their significance, sift out the large from the small, see the basic
          currents underlying surface movements and changes, and foresee the
          result sufficiently to guard against fatal error or the souring of
          unreasonable hopes?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Will Durant,Â The Map of Human Character</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The legacy I hope to leave behind is similar to that of Albert
        Einstein&#39;s. Not his groundbreaking theories, but his curiosity and
        humility. After his death,Â The New York TimesÂ wrote this: Man stands on
        this diminutive earth, gazes at the myriad of stars and upon billowing
        ocean and tossing treesâ€“and wonders. What does it all mean? How did it
        come about? The most thoughtful wonderer who appeared among us in three
        centuries has passed on in the person of Albert Einstein.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          &quot;The most thoughtful wonderer.&quot; I love that. I hope those
          words are used to describe me one day.
        </p>
