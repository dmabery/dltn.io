## Notes
- Warren Buffett isn't the best investor because he gets the highest returns. He doesn't. He's the best investor because he's generated consistent returns for a crazy long time.

- Cope's Law - species increase in size over time. But not really. Eventually, there is a middle ground and the size is perfect. Too big and you can't hide from predators. Too small and you can't beat any predators.

- You stand apart in the VC world by having values and seeing the world in a different way. The only way people can know that is if you tell them. This is why Morgan writes articles that are seemingly not related to venture capital. They are trying to differentiate themselves from other VS firms.

- Risk is just the odds that something will prevent you from reaching your goals. One person might think the stock market dropping 20% in three years is a huge risk, but someone else on a long time horizon might not think that is risky.

- Anything Morgan writes is through the lens of, "Do I personally think this is interesting?"

- The stuff that's rational isn't always reasonable and the stuff that's reasonable isn't always rational.

- There's only so much money you can give your kids before you ruin them. Give your kids a safety net, but don't be a fuel for them to not do anything at all.

- Morgan usually gets the biggest upgrade when he rents a car. This scratches the itch of "I want a Porsche", without having to buy one.

- When you look at things as Fees and not Fines, you think about it a lot less crazy. Losing money for a time from your portfolio is a price of admission, a fee to play the game. It's not that you did anything wrong. You just have to be willing to pay the fee to get the reward on the other side.

- There's an optimal amount of bullshit to deal with in life. If your tolerance for BS is 0, you're not going to have a great time in life.

- Be cautious of people who have built a platform on having a certain strong view on something because they are likely unwilling to change that no matter the evidence they receive.

### Writing advice from Morgan:
- "Every good idea I've come up with has come when I'm not trying to come up with one"

- 90% of the writing takes place on his walk

- Most times you think you have "writer's block" isn't writer's block. It's that your idea sucks. A good idea isn't hard to write about. 

- Saving scraps are super helpful. If you have a story or illustration that isn't working and scrap it, save that in a document and use it in another article sometime down the line. Morgan uses a doc called "Scrapped Bits."

- A lot of writers do themselves a disservice by trying to outline everything before you write.

- Morgan starts with one snippet or idea and writes one sentence after another to just see where it goes.

### How to increase the likelihood you won't ruin yourself financially during panic:
- If you're only planning for risks you can imagine, you're not prepping for the *actual* biggest risk. So you have to have a level of savings that seem to not make sense. A number that seems to be a bit too high. A little too conservative. I want to be prepared for the biggest risk you can't imagine.

- If cash earns 1% per year and stocks earn 10% year, the 9% gap will gnaw at you everyday. But if that cash allows you to not sell your stocks during a bear market, that cash is returning many multiples of 1%...

- External benchmark's are dumb. Don't be worried about outperforming other people. Take the amount of risk that's necessary for you to live how you want to live.
