Did a brief dive on time this morning and read some interesting article on whether or not time exists. One interesting point one of the articles made was that we know what chairs and tables are made out of–particles–but we don't know what time is made out of. Surely it doesn't just exist? Is it made out of space, like Einstein's General Theory of Relativity posits? Maybe.
