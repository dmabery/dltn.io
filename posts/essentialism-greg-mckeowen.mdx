One Sentence Summary
--------------------

The Essentialist mindset is all about doing less, but better

Two Key Takeaways
-----------------

-   Focus on your objectives. There's no way to do everything you want to do well, but you can do 1-3 things *exceptionally* well
-   Saying no is apart of life. Have one decision that makes a thousand. When presented with an opportunity to do something or take on a new task, make sure you are 100% down. If you're even 90% down, it should be an automatic 'No'! (if you have the luxury to do that of course).

-   Essentialism is not about getting more things done, it's about getting the *right* things done; making the wisest investment of your time to feed the things with the most ROI

-   Decision Fatigue - The more choices we have to make, the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates.
