Today (a Saturday), I spent the afternoon cleaning my office. After a morning full of buying a suit, dropping it off at my tailors, and reading, it was a nice way to spend the afternoon.

My bookshelves were starting to get too cluttered. I had books strewn about on the floor, and there were some books on my shelf I was probably never going to read again. Mostly business/leadership books (most of which were probably ghostwritten).

So I got rid of them. In total, about twenty.

I still have books on my floor, but they are organized into piles: to take notes on and to read.

Plus, my shelves just *look* nicer, which is always a plus.

I sprayed off my desk, threw away all the scrap paper, and organized my cart.

Finally, I sprayed some whiskey and oak room spray. It smells delicious in here.

Now, I'm sipping whiskey, listening to 50s on my record player, and am about to read some more.

A great day!

Here's what my desk looked like before:

And here's what the room looks like now!
