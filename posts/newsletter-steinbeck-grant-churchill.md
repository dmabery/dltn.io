Here are 7 things I found worth sharing, reading, watching, or listening to this week.

Let me know what you think!

* * * * *

1.  [​John Steinbeck's anti-advice for aspiring writers​](https://x.com/dltnio/status/1749092840242876485?s=20): "If there is a magic in story writing, and I am convinced there is, no one has ever been able to reduce it to a recipe that can be passed from one person to another."
2.  [​How someone treats another person​](https://twitter.com/dltnio/status/1748748662250078210) when they're down says a lot about who they really are.
3.  Winston Churchill smoked about 10 cigars a day and was hardly without a drink in his hand, yet he was at the top of his game during WW2. His trick for getting "the last scrap" out of his body? Naps. [​Read how Churchill himself described his process.​](https://www.daltonmabery.com/posts/winston-churchill-naps)
4.  Letter writing is, unfortunately, a thing of the past, but it doesn't have to stay that way. [​Read this book from 1883​](https://archive.org/details/howtowritelette01westgoog/page/n6/mode/2up) about the proper ways to write letters from the right heading, the right way to fold the paper, how to stamp it, and more. Book notes are coming soon on this! (I wonder how biographies will change in 200 years when most of a person's record is digital. It could be horrible or excellent.)
5.  Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions before you start working on something. [​"Answers are free labor is not."​](https://x.com/jasoncoxnc/status/1750526695592124907?s=20)
6.  Being able to walk through the invisible door without someone opening it for you will put you ahead of a lot of people. [​Don't wait for permission.​](https://x.com/pli_cachete/status/1749950768143016431?s=20) You can just do things.
7.  [​How John Locke created the *perfect* notebook​](https://jillianhess.substack.com/p/john-lockes-pursuit-of-the-perfect) for reading, writing, and organizing interesting information (in the 1600s!)
