Oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon are some of the fundamental elements for creating life. Without either of these, life will have a very hard time existing (if it can even get off the ground at all).

But there are other elements required to sustain life. Iron is needed to create hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that moves oxygen and carbon dioxide around in your body. Cobalt is one of the elements that B12 binds to in the body. Potassium and a small amount of sodium are used in controlling the nerves. Without them, it would be hard for your brain to send signals to your body and vice versa.

As you can see, the elements needed for creating life and the elements needed for sustaining life are not the same. So it is with most other ventures in the world.

The employees who took a company from 0-1 are not likely the same employees that are needed to take the company from 1-10.

The push you need to get a project started requires a lot of motivation and some excitement. But it requires careful planning and execution of that plan to finish the project. The one off motivation burts don't do well for achieving long term goals.

This is one of the many ways the real-world mimics the forces that control it. This is why itâ€™s important to have a brief understanding of how things in the world work. It helps you identify patterns and rules you may otherwise miss.
