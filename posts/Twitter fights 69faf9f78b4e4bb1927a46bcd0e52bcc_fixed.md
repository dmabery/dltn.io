He’s also famous for dunking on people on Twitter.

To my surprise, this academic, author, and intellectual *******actively******* thinks about these fights.

And that keeps the system in check.”

These attacks aren’t a spur of the moment decision, like most hateful comments slung on Twitter. At times, he’s been brewing them for years.
