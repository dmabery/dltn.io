If you win at whatever game you're playing right now, would you be happy?

You may not think you're playing a game, but you are. Entrepreneurs are playing the game to acquire users, get money, or create freedom for themselves. Writers are playing the game to get their material read, books published, and ideas out into the world. Influencers are playing the game to build an audienceâ€“whatever that means. Nine to five employees are playing the game to make a living, save for retirement, and have a happy life. And all of us are playing The Game of Life.

There's nothing innately wrong with playing any of these games. But if your piece is on the game board and you win, are you going to be happy about the outcome?

As I started writing this piece, I thought 'What game are you playing?' was the main question to be asked. But I don't think *what* game you're playing matters as much as *how* you play that game.

If you're an entrepreneur, do you want to build a profitable company by skimming on customer support, product expenses, and by hiring C+ people?

If you're a writer, do you want to succeed by writing about what everyone else is writing about because it's popular at the time and can get you a pricey advance? Or do you want to write a book that has original, timeless ideas and will be just as relevant in 100 years as it is today?

If you're an influencer, do you want to build an audience by copying the playbook everyone else is reading from and getting tossed in the current wave of 'Wow that's so cool!' Or do you want to build an audience because you're an amazing teacher and people want to learn from you. Or because you're an inspiring persona helping *real* people achieve their *actual* dreams?

I know which one I'd rather choose.

*What* game you're playing is important. But it's not as important as *how* you play that game. Whatever it is, play it with integrity, kindness, and genius and no matter who else has a piece on your board, you will win one way or another.
