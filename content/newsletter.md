The Wandering Reader is a curated list of ideas into the “labyrinth” of human nature (to quote John Adams).

Every week, you'll receive an email with the best insights, ideas, and stories from the books and content I consume.

My motivation is simple, to "promote useful ideas” – from writing, history, science, books, philosophy, and society. To quote Benjamin Franklin as he put forth the conversation topics for the American Philosophical Society (which he started), I aim for The Newsletter to cover…

>  all philosophical [scientific] experiments that let light into the nature of things, tend to increase the power of man over nature, and multiply the conveniences or pleasures of life…

Put simply: anything that makes me think, "Huh, I never knew that!" about an event in history, a neat invention, or a fascinating person...will go in this newsletter. I do this for one reason: I recognize the importance of promoting knowledge. I also recognize the dilution of insights and ideas published on the internet today, so I think it's important to invest time in curating a thoughtful collection of content that is educational, entertaining, and has stood the test of time.

I like to learn, so if you do too, join me.
