# The Wandering Reader

The Wandering Reader is a curated list of ideas into the “labyrinth” of human nature (to quote John Adams).

**It’s an anthology of ideas** – a “proposal for promoting useful ideas” – from writing, history, science, books, philosophy, and society. To quote Benjamin Franklin as he put forth the conversation topics for the American Philosophical Society (which he started), I aim for The Wandering Reader to cover…

>  all philosophical [scientific] experiments that let light into the nature of things, tend to increase the power of man over nature, and multiply the conveniences or pleasures of life…

Every Friday, you'll recieve an email with books, articles, speeches, interviews, or ideas that promote the most useful and timeless concepts from history.
