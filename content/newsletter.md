<p>My newsletter is a curated list of ideas into the “labyrinth” of human nature (to quote John Adams).</p>
<p>Every week, you&#39;ll receive an email with the best insights, ideas, and stories from the books and content I consume.</p>
<p>My motivation is simple, to &quot;promote useful ideas” – from writing, history, science, books, philosophy, and society. To quote Benjamin Franklin as he put forth the conversation topics for the American Philosophical Society (which he started), I aim for The Newsletter to cover…</p>
<blockquote>
<p> all philosophical [scientific] experiments that let light into the nature of things, tend to increase the power of man over nature, and multiply the conveniences or pleasures of life…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put simply: anything that makes me think, &quot;Huh, I never knew that!&quot; about an event in history, a neat invention, or a fascinating person...will go in this newsletter. I do this for one reason: I recognize the importance of promoting knowledge. I also recognize the dilution of insights and ideas published on the internet today, so I think it&#39;s important to invest time in curating a thoughtful collection of content that is educational, entertaining, and has stood the test of time.</p>
<p>I like to learn, so if you do too, join me.</p>
