## Hi, I'm Dalton
A creator and editor at Farnam Street. We help people "master the best of what others have already figured out."

I spend my free time reading, learning, and writing about history's most interesting people, ideas, essays, and inventions.

Every Friday, I send an email with interesting articles about history, science, and philosophy. Read previous editions here
