## Questions
- Why is this case named so differently than a typical case like *The People V. Miller* or something? I think it's because it's a juvenile case, but not sure.
  
	- Indeed, that's why. A lot of juvenile court cases are not about punishment necessarily, and are more about rehabilitation. The naming convention of the case reflects this. Instead of having the typical case name, which is bit adversarial (The People V Miller), juvenile court cases are title *In Re* followed by the defendant's name because the case is acting "In the matter of" or "concerning." This naming convention reflects the fact that the court is acting in the best interest of the child, and not as an adversarial prosecutor.
	  
- The court found that the appellant violated Penal Code section 647(f), which prohibits any person to be under the influence of a drug in a public setting if they cannot care for the safety of themselves or others. But, the officers didn't properly arrest the appellant until they found the bag of Tuinal, and then arrested him not for public intoxication, but for possession of a dangerous drug. How can he be arrested for one thing, but convicted of another? Or, is this *only* in reference to the charge of violation of penal code 647(f), and either the illegal drug charge was not brought formally to court, or they aren't appealing that charge.

*Intro thing*
- Involuntary act does not satisfy actus reus
  
	- What's "voluntary" then? If someone is obeying instructions from a superior, is that voluntary?
	- If defendant acted on reflex, does not satisfy actus reus requirement
	  
- If Ralph did not know he could have seizures, no, Ralph did not kill the driver. He did so involuntarily, which does not satisfy actus reus requirement. If Ralph knew he was prone to seizures, then yes, he could be on the hook for potentially involuntary manslaughter. He has a duty to care for the safety of those around him, and knowing he had seizures, should not have been driving. Society has an interest in preventing people with seizures from driving, yet, he drove. Doing so put himself and others at risk. He voluntarily drive the car knowing what might happen, which caused the death. It's as if you voluntarily dropped someone off the roof and thought they would hit the overhang of a restaurant, but instead died. Society has an interest in stopping people from being thrown off a roof, no matter the safety measures put in place to make it "safe."

*Caption*
- In re David W.
	- Why is this a different format?
- 116 Cal.App.3d 689
- Actus Reus
	- Can someone be found guilty of public intoxication, even though they did not voluntarily enter a public setting?

*Parties*
- The juvenile court
- Appellant, a 15 year old boy

*Facts*
 - 15-year-old juvenile was found to be showing symptoms congruent with being under the influence of drugs in his bedroom, violently attacking his brother. His mother called the police because appellant could harm himself and others.
 - Police showed up found found appellant in his bedroom and offered to transport him to the hospital because he needed urgent medical attention. Appellant was transported unwillingly to hospital.
 - While at the hospital, a bag of Tuinal, a dangerous drug, was found on the appellant's person. Appellant was then arrested for possession of a dangerous drug and later found guilty of CA Penal Code 647(f), essentially public intoxication.
 - Appellant is arguing that the record does not support the trial court's finding that the appellant violated Penal Code section 647(f).

*Issue*
- Whether or not the trial court properly determined if the appellant violated Penal Code Section 647(f), public intoxication, if the appellant was originally in a private place, and involuntarily taken to a public place, and therefore had no actus reus, never had any intention of ever entering a public setting in his condition, and in fact was resisting the transportation to the public place.
	- It's easy to think the public intoxication is the issue, but it's not, because that's not what the court ruled on. The court ruled on it being in a public place.

*Rules*
- Ca Penal Code 647(f)
- When the police found the appellant, he was in his bedroom at his house, which is not a public place within the meaning of the statute.
- Appellant came to public place only because he was taken there by the police while handcuffed, and while seeming to resist the transportation.

*Analysis*
- Holding: The appellant was not in violation of Penal Code section 647(f).
- Reasoning: When the police first found the appellant, he was in his bedroom at his house, which is not considered a public place within the statute. Although the appellant appeared in a public place later that night, he only did so involuntarily ("Appellant could not walk without assistance"), and while handcuffed and resisting, and so does not demonstrate having actus reus.

*Disposition*
- Trial court overturned. Reverse ruling.

*Notes and questions*
- For a defendant to be held criminally liable, there must be an Act, some physical movement of the defendant's body, and the act must be volitional. The person must be intending to commit the act. So reflexes, convulsions, movements during sleep, and conduct during or resulting from hypnosis are not sufficient because they are not criminal. Movements made while the defendant was unconscious also cannot be made liable for criminality.
  
- Changed facts are hard: whether or not the porch or just outside of his house is public property, which at first I thought wouldn't be, the judge confirms that it is. In his opinion, he writes, "Appellant came to be in a public place, to wit, the sidewalk in front of his home..." which indicates outside of his house would be public property. But if he opens the door and just stands in the doorway, I don't think that would be public property.
  
	- Say the question of public property is true, that no matter where he goes, it's public, then you have to look at whether or not he *voluntarily* went thereâ€”had the actus reus. I think you could argue either way:
	  
		- **No: It wasn't voluntary.** He was listening to the directions of an authority figure. When you do a job at work you hate, you probably aren't voluntarily doing it, but rather listening to your boss. That argument could be taken the opposite way though, as well. If your boss tells you to kill someone and you do it, can you say you didn't have actus reus? I don't think so. You know what you were doing. But what if they are going to hurt someone you love if you don't follow their directions? Well then it becomes much less voluntary. I'm leaning more this way, because the judge writes, "the fact remains that he was compelled by the police officers to go to a pubic place." If he's answering the request of the police officers to come outside, he is still being compelled by the police officers to go to a public place. 
		  
		- **Yes: it was voluntary.** No one was forcing him to come out to a public setting. He was asked, but not dragged. He voluntarily listened to their instructions and came outside. But I feel like this would set a dangerous precedent, in that, if a cop needs to arrest someone through trespassing or something, they can ask them to go over the fence and then arrest them. Why would they be going over the fence? Idk just brainstorming here.
