# Scratchpad
- Just start writing a book review to da Vinci! You can do it man,
- "Often when people face a conflict between an immediate desire and a moral principle, they find a way to bend the moral principle to make it fit the immediate desire. Especially when the moral principle is uniquely restrictive as compared with others in society." - https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology
- [[B - da Vinci]]
