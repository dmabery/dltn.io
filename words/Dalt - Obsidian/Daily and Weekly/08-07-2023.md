# Scratchpad
- A great many issues in life stem from one's search for theoretical solutions to practical problems. If you're broke, no course or book will make you un-broke. You must work and make money. That is the only way. If you read a book on how to invest or save, you will not be a good saver or investor unless you actually save and invest. Practical problems have practical solutions. Identifying which one you're struggling with is half the battle. #blog-draft

- The world would be much more #creative if people spent as much time creating their own unique thing as they did "deconstructing" other famous people's work.
	- Almost tweeted this, but didn't. Im tired of the "I spent 200 hours studying how X grew their newsletter." Bro if you spent 200 hours into researching and writing your *own* newsletter, you'd be better off.
