- I've got a lot of blogs on my [[Ugly blogs with beautiful content]] page, but I'd like a smaller list of blogs that I can check everyday or at least a few times/week. Maybe I can call this page [[Daily blogs to visit]]
- For my newsletter, I'd like to for sure do two posts/week - one on links and one on an idea/things I've learned. The links will be just direct links and many a one sentence description. The learnings from the other one will be a paragraph or two with at least two linked sources. This will help me make sure I'm creating an original piece and not just seeing something somewhere else and taking it.
