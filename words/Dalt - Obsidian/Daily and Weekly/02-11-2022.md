## Scratchpad
- Finished reading [[Einstein - His Life and Universe]] today and a bit sad about it to be honest... I'm excited to reflect on what I learned and what I admire about his life. I also went to the golf course today and hit really, really well. Excited to keep working at this, though it may come slowly. I'm excited to keep working on my course and building my site!  Finished a lot of animations for the mental models course today, too. Great, great week!
