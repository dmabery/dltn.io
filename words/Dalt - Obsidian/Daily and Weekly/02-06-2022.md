## Scratchpad
- Figured out how to sort posts with [[YAML]], [[FrontMatter]], and [[Next.js]]. I couldn't find anything like this, so this is going to be a lot of help.
- I forgot that since front matter just returns an array of objects, all regular JS and React options are available. I was looking for such a complicated way to filter and sort a YAML file, but it didn't need to be so complicated.
- [[02-07-2022]] look up best terminal designs.
- The [[Joe Rogan]] controversy is interesting.. I feel like Spotify shouldn't take it down, because they have much worse content on their platform from artists... This goes back to the argument of, should platforms be held responsible for what's on it? Idk the answer to that. [[Tim Urban]] has had some good discourse on it here: https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1490434103551868937
