# Scratchpad
- Had a great talk with [[Cj]] yesterday. Was telling him about my problems with work, and how to make great work. He gave me great advice, saying what I do is extremely important because I know, or have the resources, to capture people's attention, and everything that make the world go 'round is attention. He explained money is a lagging indicator of attention. Where people's attention is, the money will follow. But if you go to where the money currently is, you'll be behind. [[Money is a lagging indicator of attention]]
