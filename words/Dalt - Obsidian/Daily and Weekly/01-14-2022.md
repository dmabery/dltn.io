## Thoughts
Feeling a bit better today. Going to try and work a bit, but also not super worried about it.

I'm feeling, once again, the struggle of trying to do so much and it's really irritating. I want to read, write, code, and go to the gym all in the morning each day and it's just not realistic. I'm not sure if i need to think through my goals more, or think through more of an unconventional schedule to get things done.
