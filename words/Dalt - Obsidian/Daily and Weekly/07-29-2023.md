# Scratchpad
- Feeling refreshed today. Looking back over the past few years, whenever I was using Obsidian daily, I was creating the most and (I think), thinking the best and most clearly. I saw it happen even last night while listening to [[Stephan Ango on Muse Podcast]], the notes I created were threads of ideas that I wouldn't have had if I were just listening or jotting down quotes.
- I'm supposed to be doing a bunch of homework for school...but I really don't want to...lol. I'd like to, unsurprisingly, redo the *backend* of my blog this time, lol.
