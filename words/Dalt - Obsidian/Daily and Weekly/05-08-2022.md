# Scratchpad
- Today is mother's day! I have a lot of work to get done today in preparation for this week, but I'm excited about it getting back on the grind.
- I've been thinking about my content consumption routine and obvi it's a little off. I think starting a new book on Sunday and trying to finish it by the following Sunday would be ideal. I can Tweet when I start a new book and then post my learnings there each day.
- Also, I've been toying with the idea to use my Obsidian publish site as my blog and have everything there. I think it would be cool because it shows the depths of my brain a bit more and there would be less back and forth. But I think I'd need to find the perfect CSS theme and create a sidebar/nav/footer for it.
- The benefits of log over obsidian are the block refs, the tags acting as pages, and the ability to use to-dos in the app.
- The benefits of Obsidian over logseq are publish and the maturity of the software.
