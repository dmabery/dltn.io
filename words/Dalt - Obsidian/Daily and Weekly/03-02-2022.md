- #idea - a service (app, newsletter) that shows interesting, long-form content on YouTube
- "It must never be forgotten that every one is unconsciously tyrannized over by the wants of the others." - [[Edith Wharton]] #quotes 
- "People are curious. A few people are. They will be driven to find things out, even trivial things."
