## Thoughts
Spent yesterday learning a lot more #RubyonRails on dove into #NextJS. It's interesting to see things coming together and make a lot more sense. All of the cool tools I find are making sense of how they work now that I know a lot more about programming.

Trying to figure out a good balance to keep working with each course. I still want to finish the WebDev Bootcamp, the Solidity Course, and the React Course, on top of the Rails course. So it's a lot, but they're all so different I've had success switching between them.

Having read many blogs lately, but I am reading [[10 Pending/21 Readwise/Readwise/Books/How We Got to Now]] and it's fascinating. So far i learned about cold and glass. The third chapter is about sound.
