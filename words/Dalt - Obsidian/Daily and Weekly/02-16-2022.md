## Scratchpad
- I get that [[Einstein]] observed or made light of the fact that time slows down when you move, but no one really explains how or why this happens. He has his equations with Einstein's tensor, but that's too complicated.

- Listened to [[Lex Fridman]]'s interview with [[Tim Ubran]] - [[Tim Urban on Lex Fridman]] and had sooo many ideas. Will have to rewatch to make sure I get everything I want to get out of it.
- [[Cool things I've found online]] - How [[Robert Greene]] writes books
	- https://youtu.be/2ueMHkGljK0
	- "A lot of books fail because the writer loses control of the research. You are either a master of the material or it's the master of you." #quotes #research #writing [[Robert Greene]]
- [[School teaches procrastination is okay. That's bad for later in life.]]
