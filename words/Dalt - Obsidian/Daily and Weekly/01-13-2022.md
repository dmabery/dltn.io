 Started learning how to use Props in #React and my mind is blown right now haha. It's so cool and simple!!

 Also worked on class-based components and using the extends keyword that I've been so curious about. Basically, when you create a class, it has the render method available to it and that's it. You use extends to get acess to the React. Component methods on the class which offer a lot more capabilities. When using these, you have to create a constructor function and pass super(props). Super keeps the React.Component constructor function available because when you pass your own to your Class, it overrides it.

 Also learned states and how you need to set the state and update only by using setState() function.
