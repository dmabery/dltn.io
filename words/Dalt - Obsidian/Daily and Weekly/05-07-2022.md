# Scratchpad
- [[A - Create for just One Hour Each Day]]
- [[A - The Economics of Writing]]
- [[My Content Plan]]
	- One essay a month
		- The following month, that essay gets turned into a video
	- One aside newsletter per week
	- One links only newsletter per week
	- For articles, I can have an illustration style like this. I could then animate those for the video essays.
