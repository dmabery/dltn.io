# Scratchpad
- "The destiny of everything that exists is to not."
- We know people are mortal, so why are we so wrought with sadness and anger when one dies, yelling at the universe and filling with rage our hearts toward God? Does it catch us off guard? Even when we know it's coming soon for some people, we feel sadness and devestation. I feel it all the time thinking about [[Kendal]] and [[Sadie]].
