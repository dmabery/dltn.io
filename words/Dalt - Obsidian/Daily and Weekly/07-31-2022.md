# Scratchpad
- Re-configured my notes layout today. All the folders and stuff from the previous layout was confusing. I really want to just focus on collecting quotes, book notes, and interesting facts, a long with theories/terms and some lists of questions I have. Basically re-structured everything so I can work on those much easier.
