In WWII, #WinstonChurchill sent for 30,000 civilian boats to pick up soldiers on the shores of Dunkirk. They were trapped there by the enemy and had nowhere to go. Destroyers couldn't get close enough to the shore and there weren't enough small boats to ferry people back and forth. For a while, they were being picked off like fish in a barrel. It was a cool story to learn and I wonder if he talks about it in his memoirs.
