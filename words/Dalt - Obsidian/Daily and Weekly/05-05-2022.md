- #heuristic for #decision-making for spotting #insight is if people in different domains, walks of life, and sphere's of influence are all saying the same thing in a different way. This applies to book recommendations and almost anything else. #writing-inbox 
- As the time from creation of a piece of work increases, the micro advice that applies becomes less and less, but then macro ideas and philosophies remain the same. This might be the difference between a Good book, a great book. #writing-inbox
