- Saw an interesting take today on #twitter about [[student loan forgiveness]]. Someone said, if the students that went to a pricey college can't pay back their tuition, obviously the school failed them. So, they should have to pay back the debts. Obviously there is a lot of nuance there, but it is a very interesting thought.
