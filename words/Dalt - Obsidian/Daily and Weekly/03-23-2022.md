# Scratchpad
- Re-started [[12 Rules For Life]]
- I love the [[Letters of Note]] newsletter. You get to create a community of people who love what you love *and* you get to practice being a writer. I'd love to start a project like this and call it the Almanac of Literary Giants or Letters from Writers where I share quotes from interviews and letters that writers have written about or sent to someone else.
