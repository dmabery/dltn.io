# Scratchpad
- To be able to do a graphics brainstorm well, before defined scripts, I need lectures/course structure, the key point of each lecture, and a script. I can't make graphics based on "Distill a model." The videos don't have to be filmed or a script finalized, but I do need a script to work off of.
