# Scratchpad
- One of the worst ideas I was taught as a kid was that different disciplines are completely separate. Science is different from math, math from philosophy, philosophy from art, art from history, and so on. Each discipline is segmented into its own textbook and taught in a silo. Maybe someone can make the connection to discipline's, but that's not the intuitive thing to do.
