# Scratchpad
- [[Kendal]]'s third day in the hospital today. She's feeling better, but very much ready to get out of here.
- Insight is found by not ditching half-baked ideas. Those ideas that you think might be really good, but have some holes in the logic. Those ideas that you heard in a podcast or movie and wished they went into the topic more, but didn't. Those ideas that you thought of during a random conversation with someone at a coffee shop. Those half-baked ideas are special. #idea #creative-inspiration #creativity 
- #writing-advice on how to write a long document from [[[David Perell]] - identify each section or island in the article. You don't have to worry about how they connect right now. Each day, write about one of the islands. When you have the body of each island, arrange them in a way that makes the most sense and create the transition statements.
