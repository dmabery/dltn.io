## Thoughts
Was sick the last few days so that was a huge bummer. But I have been using the down time to think about what I want to do and work on this year. Really, who I want to be. 

I know I want to be a writer and developer, but I'm not sure what that means really. Every day I see someone doing something cool and i think, "man I want to do that."

Really cool excercise:

Here’s an exercise recommended by Hugh Jackman: Take a picture of something you stare at every day — it could be your backyard or your neighborhood street, for example. Send it to a service that can turn the image into a jigsaw puzzle. As you work to complete the puzzle, you’ll zone in on the image for so long that you’ll notice things you’ve never noticed in your own backyard before. “You’re focusing on the minute details of this building and that building or that tree, this tree,” Jackman says. “When you go back to that place, your appreciation of the world is so much greater.”
