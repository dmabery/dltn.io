# Scratchpad
- 4. Each day stop writing just a bit before you have said everything you want to.  Better to approach your next writing day "hungry" than to feel "written out."  Your biggest enemy is a day spent not writing, not a day spent writing too little. [[Tyler Cowen]] #writing

- In the late 1980s, two psychologists from the University of Rochester developed a theory about what we need to feel motivated to do something. They called this “[[Self Determination Theory]]” (SDT).
  
  SDT says that to feel motivated, we need to fulfil three basic psychological needs. The first is _autonomy_ - the feeling that you have control over your goals, your day, and whether what you do is important. The other two factors are _competence_ (the feeling that you are good at what you do) and _relatedness_ (the feeling of being connected to other people).

- The news has sent shares in Twitter up more than 30%, with more than **$13 billion** worth of shares changing hands on Monday _**alone**_. That's more than double even the busiest days of trading from Twitter's 8-and-a-half years as a public company. It's way more than the $5bn that changed hands on Twitter's first day of trading after its IPO, it's more than was traded when Google was rumored to be looking at acquiring Twitter in 2016 and it's **4x** what was traded when Donald Trump was banned from the platform last year. more: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmvnzRwzzrmPRnSthlCvXncrJL

- Came across something I think I've been looking for for awhile now called Indie Thinkers - an accelerator for online intellectuals. I filled out the form and excited to hear back and see how it goes.
- Most startups don't die at the hands of a competitor.  It's more often something like an internal implosion, the founders giving up, or not building something people want (and failing to remedy that situation). You can win by endurance. #startup-advice [[Sam Altman]]
