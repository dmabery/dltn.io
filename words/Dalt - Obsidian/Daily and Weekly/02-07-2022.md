## Scratchpad
- Spent time working on my site over the weekend and I'm happy with it! Going to refactor the code now because I think I can keep everything in one folder and filter the array that gets returned from the posts getStaticProps function.
- Use layout for article from Farnam Street and tags from Farnam Street too. - [[Cool things I've found online]]

	- Could do something like this for titles on my blog to add just a bit more design to it.
	- Create a component to render the title of the page and a description if there is one.

	- add this subscribe element to the end of all blog posts. Instead of adding directly, I could create a component and add that to the end of the blog and notes layout page. Much simpler and doesn't interrupt the reader directly.
