- “We write for the same reason that we walk, talk, climb mountains or swim the oceans — because we can. We have some impulse within us that makes us want to explain ourselves to other human beings. That’s why we paint, that’s why we dare to love someone- because we have the impulse to explain who we are. Not just how tall we are, or thin… but who we are internally… perhaps even spiritually. There’s something, which impels us to show our inner-souls. The more courageous we are, the more we succeed in explaining what we know."

— Maya Angelou #quotes [[Writing Bits I Love]] 

- In [[Edison]], I learned that he once made comments to a reporter about the metaphysical, religion, and life after death. He was pretty harsh in his tone, demanding proof for the existence. A lot of people were upset. In fact, a newspaper wrote a striking paragraph essentially condemning Edison for stepping outside his domain of expertise. They stressed the fact that just because Edison was a genius inventor, that doesn't mean he's an expert on the metaphysical souls of humans and can speak to their immortality.
