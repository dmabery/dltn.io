## Scratchpad
- Could I turn my evergreen notes into animated YouTube videos? Like 2 - 3:00 minutes or so
- [[Drama triangle]] - We have learned how to do relationship in this role of victimhood.
	- Pure victim - Sense of disempowerment, very whiney
	- Villain - Blamer. Who's fault is it.
	- Hero - Seek temporary relief from something, but never address the core issue.
		- Heroes need victim's so you are disempowering people so you can maintain your hero status.
