## Scratchpad
- Started reading [[Edison]]
- Worked on my site reorganization which felt good.
- Wrote a #blog-post about why I publish my notes online
- Went to the gym. Felt great
- Worked on mental model videos for work
- #read for an hour of [[Edison]] - it's much more heady than Einstein was and it's written backwards. Kinda strange but I'm interested to see how it is!
