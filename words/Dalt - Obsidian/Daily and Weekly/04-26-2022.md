# Scratchpad
- External hard drive took a dump on me last night. If I want to seriously edit videos as a career, then I need to figure out:
	- File storage
	- Ethernet cables
	- Computer/workspace
		- Think I really want to get the Mac Studio and a boatload of external hard drives to manage the storage. Some sort of overkill Seagate or something.
