# Scratchpad
- Copying other writers' work or copying good design from websites is actually useful as a skill to get better, but if you use it to ignore the main thing – writing original work, designing something from scratch – it's nothing more than an illusion of progress, a coping mechanism you run to in fear of actually confront a blank page and a blank rectangle.
- Don't look at the cannonballs, look at the ripples.
	- Don't focus on the big impact or the huge event, look at the second-order effects 
- [[No one cares what you can do fresh]]
