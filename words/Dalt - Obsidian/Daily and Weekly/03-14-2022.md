# Scratchpad


## Tasks
- Read and think about YouTube channel (see below) Wake +1hour
- **YT clip - Stanley 8 - 9**
- YT stats 9 - 10; send email too
- **AMA edit 10-12**
- Lunch
- Code 12 - 2
- Text Jake and Zack about cameras
- Really think about YouTube and if/how I want to pursue it... I think I'm gifted there and to not utilize that gift seems to me a mistake and like I'm neglecting a really great gift that I have. The note taking/app content and audience is obviously there.
	- Could do 2-3 minute riffs like the ideas and call them 'coffee talks'. Sort of like Ben Shapiro does. And then mix in Obsidian/Notion/Note taking app tutorials or code tutorials as I see fit.
- ACD video
- Think about some article ideas to send to Dan
