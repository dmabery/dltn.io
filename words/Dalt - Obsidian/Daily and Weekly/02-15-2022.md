## Scratchpad
- Feeling off today for some reason... don't have a new book to read which messed up my morning routine, but I spent some time working with my Obsidian organization. 
- I need to figure out how I want to manage my tasks because the system I currently have is not working...
- Started Reading [[Einstein's Cosmos]]
- Had a few revelations about who I am and my personal "brand." I really love [[moth minds]] and what the founder embodies + her online content. it's down to earth and really thoughtful.
	- Incessantly curious
	- periodic creator
	- following my curiosity and encouraging others to do the same
	- found a little astronaut guy that I love and think it would be a good character to use in articles and posts.
