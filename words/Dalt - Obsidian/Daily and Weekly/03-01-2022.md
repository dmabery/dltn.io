## Scratchpad
- Should the lawyer you have matter? If the goal of a jury or court is to find out what's fair/who is responsible, it shouldn't matter who you have on your side. Provided they understand the law and know the intricacies of it, it shouldn't matter. The other side of the case should provide their fair argument and get something that makes sense for both sides. Right? [[Questions I have for the universe]]
