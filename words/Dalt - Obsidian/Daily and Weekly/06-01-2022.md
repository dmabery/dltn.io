# Scratchpad
- Having a great morning so far at [[Bloom]]! About to read [[B - da Vinci]] with a coffee and a scone and going to meet with [[Josh Powers]] later.
- [[How new discoveries can rewrite history]] p.318 da Vinci. **Blog about this**
	- We don't actually *know* history, we just have a few good guesses based on what we know now.
