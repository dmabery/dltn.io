## Scratchpad
- What happens to the Theory of Relativity in black holes?
	- Schwarzschild radius - How would time dilate to zero for someone who is close to one of these as seen by someone who is far away? p.250 [[Einstein: His Life and Universe]]
- [[Inertia]] is simply an interaction between masses. It's caused only by the rotation *relative* to all other objects in the universe. If all other objects disappeared, so would inertia.
- [[Cosomological Considerations in the General Theory of Relativity]]
