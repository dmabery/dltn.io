## Scratchpad
- This was a great weekend! I spent all morning on Saturday reading and writing at Bloom and did errands the rest of the day taking care of the things Kendal wanted me to do. On Sunday, I deployed my site on Vercel, watched golf all day [[Scottie Scheffler]] won and then went to dinner with [[Kendal]], it was awesome.
- I'm done reading [[Einstein - His Life and Universe]] and I'm not sure what to read next...
- [[A long way to go for a ham sandwhich]]
