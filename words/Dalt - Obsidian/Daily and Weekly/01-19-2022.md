## Thoughts
Thought a lot yesterday about how my desire to be good at a lot of things is keeping me from being great at one thing. That was my inital revelation at least.

I then read Steph's "To Be Great, Be Consistently Good" and think maybe I just need to stick with something longer before I switch it up. I started video editing my freshmen year of high school and look at me now,  I can do alot.

I also started playing golf more seriously in August and could barely hit my driver - now look at me. It's going to take time. Nothing will happen over night and if I keep comparing my day 100 to someone else's day 10,000, life is going to be rough. I need to stop comparing myself and just live life.

Had the #goal of being a full-time writer and developer by 2023... Idk if this is what I want, but it's ambitious and I like the sound of it. If I'm a full-time writer, I can write for my job and develop on my free time. If I'm a full-time developer, I can develop for my job and write on my free time. THis is going to be much easier than editing videos for my job and writing AND developing on my free time, combined with trying to play golf and going to the gym + reading a lot. It's just too much to do.

But the only way I can get to that point in 2023 is if I keep developing and keep writing **today**...
