## Scratchpad
- Started on [[Einstein - His Life and Universe]] book summary and notes. There are a lot of sections in this book I want to expand on and write my own article on eventually. I think for now, I want to get every highlight and note in one doc and then sort like a Brain Pickings article.

## What I consumed today
- "Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you discover they're not." #quotes - [[Paul Graham]]
	- "Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they'll be right. Far from it. But though it's not a sufficient condition, it is a necessary one." #quotes 
	- http://paulgraham.com/words.html
