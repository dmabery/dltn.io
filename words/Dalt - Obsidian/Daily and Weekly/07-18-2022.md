- Why I love #science and #history #quotes 
	- To move forward, science needs to _fail,_ which runs counter to our human desire for certainty. “_We are surrounded by horizons, by incompleteness._” Rather than give up, we struggle along a scale of progress. What makes us human is this journey to understand more about the mysteries of the world and explain them with reason. This is the core of our nature.
- [[One of the most important things to learn is to have a plan or routine about what to do when you don't know what to do.]]
