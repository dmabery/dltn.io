### Some thoughts...
Really, really confused about the world right now. A country is attacking another country and people have the audacity to use it as clout to get followers or become a "thought leader." Anyone who posts a thread today or promotes their work should be unfollowed by everybody. It's disgusting. They will never not be, "the person who did this during a scary moment for a lot of people."

- Writer **Ralph Waldo Emerson** on making each day a masterpiece: #quotes 

"Finish every day and be done with it. For manners and for wise living it is a vice to remember. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it well and serenely, and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. This day for all that is good and fair. It is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the rotten yesterdays."
