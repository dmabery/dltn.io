# Scratchpad
- [[Gurantee Funds]] - https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGpFgrvGGxcKZZmHbqcHZvwHCJM
- Today is the end of a very, very long work week. Feeling a bit frustrated in that I haven't been able to chase some curiosities I've had this week and didn't have much thinking time.
	- Wondering about the whole [[Jack Ruby]] and [[JFK]] thing along with [[Jolly West]], so I'm excited to explore that more.
	- I'm also trying to figure out what I want my brand to be on Twitter, again, and struggling to do so. I like the idea about "Sharing interesting things that you've never heard about before" or something along those lines. Could have my pinned tweet introducing myself a bit more and then linking to all of those tweets. I'd like to position myself as a social person as well for Farnam Street.
- For my #newsletter, could have two emails/week - Saturday morning and Wednesday morning. Wednesday morning is an idea or mini-essay or muse I've been pondering or specific area of research.
- Saturday, can be interesting things I found online and want to share with the everyone for their weekend.
	- I wonder about the send rates sending it on Saturday?
- The Bookshelf (is the essay) and then links could be 221B - a nod to Sherlock Holmes
