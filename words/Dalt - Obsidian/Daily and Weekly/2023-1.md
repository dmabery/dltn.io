		- Who?
			- Dena/Cheyne
				- Focus on academic work/ability to think critically. Also, as the Dean's of Thrive College, you were in a unique place to see how I handled the rigorous demands of school, internship D-Group, and so on. Since I didn't have a relationship with any other professor, you are my "academic" reference.
			- Caine?
			- CJ?
			- Josh Powers?
				- Focus on ability to think critically, below the surface of the information communicated (or not communicated), and the ability to take action. Sharing the story about me asking to make a slide the first night of campus tours would help! Just a suggestion.
