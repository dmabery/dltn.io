	- Foetel globin is produced until you are about five years old, then your body starts to produce adult globin. The adult globin is defective, and starts the process of sickle cell systems. Interestingly though, some patients who have the gene mutation for sickle cell never experience symptoms because they never start to produce adult globin. Until now, scientists didn't know what caused that to happen. They found out that the patients essentially were missing the "code" in the DNA to turn the adult globin on. Using CRSPR, they were able to replicate this effect with genes in a lab. This could be a huge step toward helping sickle cell.
