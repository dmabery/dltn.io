## Scratchpad
- Great way to write, "I don't know enough about X yet." You don't have to say anything at all, simply mentioning what's going on makes you seem not like a complete jerk and tone deaf
	- P.S. It feels weird not to mention the fact that Russia is currently bombing Ukraine, but I haven’t read enough about it yet to have anything novel to say. All I can say at the moment is that it’s weird and scary and I’m sad for the Ukrainians and I really hope this isn’t the first page of some long awful story. [[Tim Urban]] #communication-in-chaos
