Someone on Twitter—I forget who—once explained most book critiques are usually either: "I thought this book was going to be about X, and it was about Y." Or, "This book *should have* been about X, and it was about Y."

That is a cheap way to critique a book, for you can't judge something for what it's not.

The author of a website I visit frequently does this with his book reviews. The site, Best Presidential Bios, I am in fact envious of. I think what he set out to do, and accomplish, is a feat like no other that needs to be praised and would make the world a whole lot better off if more people followed suit.

However, he often critiques a book for what it's not. For example, in a review for *Mornings on Horseback* by David McCullough, he writes:

> But McCullough’s approach possesses several shortcomings. Most importantly for the ardent Teddy Roosevelt fan, the book never fully penetrates his mind or his soul. Although his actions are well-described and his family life revealed in colorful detail, the reader never gets really gets to know the future president or understand how his childhood experiences shaped his later career.

The book wasn't intended to "fully penetrate his mind or soul." The subtitle of *Mornings on Horseback* is, "The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt."

He did this again with *Team of Rivals* by Doris Kearns Goodwin:

> Lost to the reader due to the need to jump between the early lives of the four main characters is a more comprehensive exploration of Lincoln’s scrappy frontier upbringing and his intense desire for self-improvement. While benefitting from time spent with Seward, Chase and Bates, it comes at the expense of a richer, more vibrant understanding of Lincoln’s evolution from unskilled laborer to budding lawyer to astute politician and master-of-leader.
> 
> Those who have not yet read a more comprehensive account of Lincoln’s early life (by Burlingame, White, Donald, Oates or others) will be largely unaware of the missing color. But for a Lincoln aficionado, Goodwin’s description of Lincoln’s early decades of life may seem slightly rushed or flat.
> 
> Also disappointing for me was Goodwin’s too-efficient handling of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Where other biographers highlight these debates as the crucial pivot-point in Lincoln’s political progression, Goodwin provides a less enthralling account and seems to underemphasize their significance somewhat.

Goodwin's description of Lincoln's early life is rushed or flat because it needs to be rushed or flat. The book is already some 700 pages and seeks to encapsulate how and why Lincoln surrounded himself with his political "rivals." To do that effectively, Goodwin needed to skip parts of Lincoln's upbringing to make room for the upbringing of Seward, Bates, and Chase. This book is not a Lincoln biography, it is a study of Lincoln's political genius, and that's exactly what it is.

In *How to Read a Book*, Mortimer Adler confronts this issue of people expecting the wrong thing from a book with people's reactions to Gibbon's *History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:*
