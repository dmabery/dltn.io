I think there needs to be an insane amount of trust to get good feedback from people that's hard to create at work. Trust is important because most co-workers will use feedback, especially if it's public, to signal intelligence. "I caught this, and they didn't. I'm brilliant!" even if they're unconsciously doing so. So, the comments aren't really about making something better. They're also afraid of looking stupid in front of everyone. So they might all say the same, safe answer so as to not diverge too far from the crowd or say something "wrong." Compared to if your absolute best friend asks you for feedback on something, you don't care how you come across. You just truly want to make them better.
