I've read two posts lately that are some version of "if you work really hard, you might be able to do some great things."

That's true, and desperately needed as a reminder for people. Maybe it's social media, or the rise of content in general, that makes people think they can be successful, easily. We're bombarded with videos and movies and tv shows about influencers who just posted enough, and all of the sudden their rich.

"I just gotta keep making content, man, and grow an audience, and then I'll have freedom and can do whatever I want." That's, unfortunately, the attitude of so many smart, ambitious people.

But I don't want to live in a world where smart ambitious people want to be entertainers (because that's really all an influencer/content creator is). I don't want the best minds in math and physics and business to sell online courses to make a quick buck. I want them to *build.*
