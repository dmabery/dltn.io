		- ![[LEGAL ENGLISH GLOSSARY Glossary of Legal English Terms_Mcgeore Summer Bridge Academy 2024.pdf]]
	- **Learning**
		- Chunking
			- Split items into smaller things

			- Checks and Balance of Arbitrary Behavior
		- CA State Supreme Court Justices
		- *American Law 101*
- **Session 2: Case Reading, Briefing, [This is pre-class] and Time Management**
	- **Critical Reading Cases**
		- There is no binding effect on trial court opinions, so they aren't published. Trial opinions can't become common law. District Courts are published, but don't have binding affect. They have persuasive value.
		- *Analogical reasoning* - Something lawyers do all of the time; best get good at it! (This is what I do already with history books.)
		- When you read, read like a lawyer. "I'm an attorney, and I have to advise the client and solve their problem. I'm going to do so by reading this case."
			- *There is a direct correlation between students who engage in critical reading and law school performance.*
				- Q: so what exactly is critical thinking?
				- Q: if there is no right answer, how are exams graded? The originality of the thinking and cases cited? Like does someone's answer get better if they cite some really niche case? Or does it not matter the cases, because everyone will know the same cases, rather does it matter the clarity of expression of those cases? So not just the knowledge of the cases, but written clearly and well?
		- 1. Develop context for the case you're reading
			- What's the topic? What's the sub-topic?
			- What is the level of the court?
			- Who wrote the opinion?
			- Who are the parties?
			- Who is appealing? (Who lost at trial?)
			- When was it decided?
			- Where, geographically, was it located?
			- Citation breakdown![[Screenshot 2024-07-16 at 5.59.10 PM.png]]
		- 2. Read strategically - Read Like a Lawyer, McCaine
			- Basic/Default
				- Underlining, paraphrasing, writing in the margin
					- Good start, not enough though
			- Intermediate/Problem-solving (start here)
				- Noting the context before reading
				- Ask questions while reading
					- Have a conversation with a judge
				- Hypothesize - where do you think the case is going to go?
					- Evaluate after you read; where did you go wrong?
				- Synthesize what you read; explain in your own words.
			- Expert/Evaluative (get here by week two)
				- Connecting the text to the purpose for which you're reading it
				- Connect to cases or materials you've read
					- other classes, other cases, other knowledge
				- Anticipate hypotheticals
					- What if instead of smoke, it was spit?
				- I believe the main point of reading this case in the context of this course is to learn:
			- How many times do I read? 3-4 times
				- 1. read without any instruments; just light read
				- 2. use problem solving and evaluating strategies
				- 3. read it with the goal to find the briefing elements
		- Anatomy of a case
			- Disposition: Courts instruction to lower court
			- Why is actus reus pluarl but mens rea singluar
			- Q: is it embarrassing for a judge to have a case overturned? Or if the same judge keeps getting cases overturned, does that cause for investigation or removal?
			- I think I can make a new note for every case with thoughts as I read, and also tag it with issues and classes and such

	- **Briefing cases**
		- Overview
			- Each professor may want you to brief cases differently. The professor uses different terms they want included.
				- To find out what they want, listen to the questions they ask about every case. If they ask for issues every case, issues should be at the top, and so on.
			- Focus on the process, not the product or the formatting. Make it efficient.
			- Remember: cases are not written for law students. They usually follow a pattern though (IRAC):
				- Issue
				- Rule
				- Analysis
				- Conclusion
					- This is also how you will write your essay exam answers!!
			- When you get to the briefing, you've already done all of the hard, critical thinking. That's where most of the work is.
		- Include the page number where you found the information in the case book.
		- Issue and rule:
			- Issue
				- Whether or not the court should have convicted the defendant in a situation where the defendant did not intend to commit a crime, yet failed to comply with a traffic signal because his breaks were not working properly and he did not know that was the case.
			- Ruling
				- Since the defendant had no reason to believe his brakes were faulty, prior to this incident, there is no basis for an argument of negligence.
				- Although not in every circumstance the defendant has to be consciously committing a crime to break the law, they can be convicted on pure negligence. If the person is in a position to prevent some negligence with a reasonable amount of exertion, and fails to do so, they can be convicted. However, since the person had no prior brake trouble, and we're assuming kept his car maintained properly, since he had no prior knowledge  
		- Elements of a brief
			- Caption
				- Case name
				- Citation
				- Level of Court
				- Casebook page # 
				- Summary (what is the case about e.g. Actus Reus)
			- Parties
				- Who are the parties and what are the roles?
				- Can use pi and delta to designate plantiff and defendant.
			- F-IRAC
				- Facts (+procedural history)
					- *Relevant* facts: what happened? - In your own words. You can look in the Analysis part of the case; what facts do the court use and address? Those are the relevant facts.
						- Use bullet points
					- How did this case get to appellate court? What procedural thing happened at trial court that the trial court is appealing?
						- You don't need to include everything, just what's relevant to the course
						- Who is appealing what?
						- What happened in the lower court?
						- How did it get to appellate court?
				- Issue
					- You should know what's at issue from context. Reading *just* the issue, you should be able to determine a lot about the case without reading the entire case.
					- Or from what the court writes about in the opinion
						- Whether...did...was
						- Did the lower court properly...
						- Was the defendant's motion...
						- Whether the trial court properly...
					- Template
						- Did/whether______
						- Key legal terms______
						- Key facts________
				- Rules (Q: little confused on this - just the ruling?)
					- What the standard the court set out that it applied in this case.
					- **What is the law the court is relying on to make the decision, or, what is the rule the court is creating that can be used in future cases.**
					- Rules may be:
						- The rules the court may be relying on
						- An interpretation of existing rules
						- A completely new rule that comes out of the case that you are reading.
						- Policy
				- Analysis (Reasoning and holding)
					- Holding: Court's decision on the issue - it is the answer to the issue statement you created - needs to be a full sentence - if issue and holding don't match, you got lost somewhere along the way
						- May be broad, or narrow
					- Reasoning: Why - why did the court rule the way that it did.
						- What was the court's train of thought?
				- Conclusion/disposition
					- Instructions from high court to lower court
						- Affirmed
						- Denied
						- Reversed and Remanded
						- Etc..
				- Summary of notes
					- What did i learn from the case?
					- How does this case fit into big picture?
					- Write a narrative; did you like this case?
				- Notes and questions after the case
					- Read and summarize these! They might be topic of conversation tomorrow.
				- Needs to be about a page - page and a half. If it's longer than that, it's not a brief.
				- Briefing template
						 ![[Session 2 Briefing Template.pdf]]
- **Session 3: Professors panel**
	- Where to take law in literature seminar?
