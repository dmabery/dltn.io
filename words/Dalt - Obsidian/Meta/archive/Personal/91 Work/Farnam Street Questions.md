1. What sparked your interest in digital design and creation?
	1. I had to take a class in high school and every two weeks we learned a new technology or software. We spent a month in both Photoshop and Premiere and it just clicked for me. I was helping my friends do certain things in class and then started watching YouTube tutorials. And that's where it really took off. I liked it because I could teach it to myself - I didn't have to have a teacher or anything with me. I could type in "How to get a glass shattering affect in After Effects" on YouTube and get 10 videos I could watch. And after a few hours of editing I'd emerge from this room with something that I could look at and say "I created that." And that was a feeling I didn't really get anywhere else in life.

2. What tools do you use in programming or building digital content?
	1. The tools I use might be different from the tools you might use today. I pretty much use every app that is in the Adobe Creative Cloud package. Mainly Premiere for videos, Photoshop and Illustrator for graphics, After Effects for animation and graphics and InDesign for PDFs and signs.
	   
	   I've been using Figma a lot more too, which is really popular right now in the creative space because of the collaboration abilities and it's pretty easy to use. It's also free, which is nice.
	   
	   The question mentioned programming as well, which is what I do on the side and I use VS Code for that. 

3. What is something you wish you'd been told about digital design when you started?
	1.Probably that there's going to be a lot of late nights hahaha. 
	
	I'm kidding, but I've got a couple things here. The first is that there are almost an infinite amount of ways to get something done when it comes to creative work and your way might be different from my way and that's great because that's what makes your work yours and my work mine.
	
	I was really nervous when I first started professionally that I didn't have the right techniques or anything like that but for the most part, people just want something that looks great. And if you can deliver that, than that's all that matters. 
	
	Another thing I wish'd I'd known was how to price projects better. Because once you tell someone you can make videos or graphics, someone will always ask like hey can you do this or that for me. And those are great because you get practice with someone you know and are comfortable with but it's always been hard for me to price projects to where I feel I'm earning the amount that I should be and the client is paying a fair price.
	
	Finally, and this is probably the most helpful advice I've ever heard and it was from a creative director I used to work with and it was You are not your ideas. It's so simple, but it's really easy to attatch your worth and who you are to your creations and work and then when someone doesn't like it or votes for a different one, it's easy to feel "They don't like me. I suck at this. I spent so much hard work on this and they don't even like it." And then it's easy to become spiteful and that leads to some dark places and that leaks out into the rest of the creative environment and people are no longer designing and creating with passion and that's a bad place to work in as a creative. So when I heard that advice for the first time it really helped me.

4. What was the hardest part of the learning process going into your field?
	1. Dealing with the people haha. I'm joking but I'm also pretty serious. The design and creation part of the job is easy when you learn the ropes and kinda know what you're doing. 
	   
	   But No matter how many classes you take or YouTube tutorials you watch, nothing will prepare you for dealing with clients. It's difficult because they're often times emotionally attached to your work because it's for them and you're emotionally attached to your work because it's yours so naturally, that could cause some conflict.
	   
	   I remember I did a big project my junior year of high school for some parents of graduation seniors and it did not go as planned... It was this group of five or 6 guys who's moms wanted to create a big slideshow of their lives and play it at their graduation party. And this is a project I started about a year before because I realized a lot of parents would want to do this and they'd pay a lot of money for it haha. So I started working on this project and because it was going to be so large, I wanted to get working on it as soon as i could. So I priced it out for each parent and started working on it and that was where I went wrong.
	   
	   How this project worked is I'd take photos that the families had and I'd create a slideshow out of them synced to some songs that they wanted to play. Every project before this was pretty standard where the family would give me a flash drive with the photos on it in order and I'd just take them and make it and it was pretty easy.
	   
	   But one of the parents had hard copies, like printed out of their kid and I don't mean like 20 or 30 but like a few hundred and since I didn't clarify the scope of work, I had to then scan every single one of those images, fix the coloring on them and so on. And she told me she had even more on her computer but it was broken or not working so I said I could stop by and try to get them. So I go over there one day and it was super awkward because her family was having dinner and here I am, ya know some junior in high school with my laptop knocking on the door like some traveling IT guy saying like "Hey let me look at your computer." So anyway I grab the photos from the computer and she was like Oh I have a few more in the garage here so we go in there and she opens the door and it's just boxes and boxes and boxes of more photos that I had to scan haha.
	   
	   So that's just one story of many that I have between a client and me where things have gone wrong because I'm too excited to get into the work and start creating and didn't set expectations and clarify the scope of work properly.
	   
	   But this also applies if you're working for a creative role in a company as well. When you pitch creative work to a boss or a team, they look at it with a thousand different thoughts and ideas they'd like to contribute because people love to be a part of that process. So you not only have to create the work, but you have to manage their feelings and emotions about the work while also managing your emotions about the work.
	   
	   So yeah dealing with the people and I mentioned this before but also figuring out pricing - like do I want to do hourly vs project, what's my rate, how do I estimate how long it's going to take and things like that are difficult.

5. Did you go to college, and if so, which college and what was your major?
	1. I did go to college, fully online to a school in Florida called Southeastern University and majored in Digital Media & Design. I didn't have any special ties to this college or anything, the opportunity just came up with an internship I did after I graduated that I was doing and I took it.
	   
	   I think if I had the choice to do it over, I might go to a more media-centric school to get a bit more experience and make connections in the industry though.

6. What has been the most fun thing you have created?
	1. This is probably the hardest question for me hahaha - I've had a lot of cool projects. Probably the most fun was a couple I did for my old job. It was at a church and for conferences or big events we'd shape a huge LED wall around the stage and we always had this intense opening. Well for one event we had a spoken word poem read, but it was just supposed to be dark for the entire thing and I asked if I could make sort of a kinetic typography video for it. So i was able to make that and then watch it in a room full of people on this huge LED wall and that was pretty special for me.

7. Why did you start working for Farnam Street?
	1. I actually came across Farnam Street probably three or four years ago or so and just started working for them last May. But I fell in love with the content because it was one of the few times I came across a website and thought "Man I wish I was involved with this." The catchphrase then I'm pretty sure and it still is now was Mastering the Best of what other people have already figured out and that's how I like to live my life. When I'm not editing or programming, I read and write about history and try to understand this crucial question of How We Got to Now.
	   
	   So anyway was following the company and Shane on Twitter and Shane Tweeted one day they were looking for a video editor/producer for the podcast. I replied with some work I did for a company called Morning Brew and he reached out and here I am. So I gotta thank Twitter for the job haha. 

8. What did you learn from college or education that helps you in digital design rightÂ now?
	1. This is honestly a tough question for me to answer because I probably learned more from online courses and YouTube. But when you really master a program and understand all of its capabilities and how to do different things, the opportunities are endless. One trap that is easy to fall in is once you know how to do a few things that look nice in Premiere or Photoshop or whatever, you end up using that over and over again for each project and everything will start to look the same. And of course you're going to have a specific design style and that's not what I'm talking about. Instead, what I mean is you think you know how to use the software well, but you're only using maybe 10% of what it's truly capable of. So constant learning about what the programs can do is helpful. I still learn things some apps can do that I'm kinda blown away by and had no idea they could do that.
 
9. What should one study to pursue this type of career, and what other careers exist in your field?
	1. I truly think you could study any field and pursue this career on your free time. With content creation being the main play from almost every company now from podcasts to YouTube or TikTok videos to blogs, you could work almost anywhere and do creative work.
	   
	   So if you're interested in finance and money, you can study that and do some video stuff on the side and then go make content for a company like Morning Brew, which is what I was doing, or Business Insider or something like that.
	   
	   If you love math you could study math and then help create content for a math or tutoring company.
	   
	   But if you do want to get directly into this field than anything in design, cinematography, illustration, photography are all great places to start. Most college curriculums will have you take a few classes in each of those fields, no matter what your major is, you'll just take a few more on learning whatever your major is.
	   
	   I'd also start now collecting every piece of content you've made and putting in a folder to access when you create a website. Unlike other jobs where resumes are important, in a creative field, people want to see your style and they want to see what you've already made. So the easier that is to access and the more of it there is, the better. So highly recommend making a personal website or something to store all of your work. And when you do that, don't just post the work but write a bit about what you're thinking process was, how you chose this font over that one, why you decided to use this LUT over a different color feel, and so on.
	   
	   And that kinda goes into what other jobs are in this field, so besides the actual video editing, designing, and illustrating there are a lot of idea jobs, but they usually come after a bit of experience. So for example Creative Director is a popular job at most agencies or creative departments and they basically oversee anything creative - they pitch the ideas to the bosses and make sure all the departments are talking to each other. Copy writing is another great job in the creative space because a lot of times great designs or videos are great because of their script or text and not just the video. So knowing how the manipulate words and use language creatively is always a plus. YouTube professional is also really popular now, as companies are trying to understand YouTube more and not just throw random videos up there and hope it gets views. So someone who understands the platform and knows what will work is always good. The same thing with TikTok as well - and it's always a bonus if you know video and you also know a platform really well. That's how I eventually got hired for my job now because running the YouTube is one of my main responsibilities. 
	   
	   There are differences between a cinematographer and a video editor as well. So a lot of people like to shoot video and play with lighting and audio and others like to just get the video files and edit them, so you don't have to be a both and, but you could be. I know I personally prefer the editing side of things much more than the videography but that sometimes comes in seasons.
	   
	   There's also a difference between a graphic designer who works with images and text, an illustrator who makes things characters and objects from scratch, and an animator who takes the things designers and illustators makes and makes them move. Again, there are people who can do all of them, but if you're working at an agency or a large creative department, their will most likely be experts in each one so it kinda depends which route you think you want to take.

11. What advice do you have for us about digital design, content creation, and the Mental Model we are learning about?
	1. The reason I love mental models is because it allows you to have a wide domain of knowledge in so many fields and that has helped me think about designs and assets in new ways that I wasn't able to before. Most of the time, I'm able to use a mental model help me illustrate something in a design that I couldn't before. So just keep learning and mastering them.
	   
	   Secondly, I just want to encourage people to follow their curiosity and take that road where it leads you. You could love Rennesaisnce paintings and want to know more about those, so you end up making a little mini-doc or graphic illustrating the different paintings that came out of that era. Or you could love sci-fi and space and what the future has to hold, make a mood board as if you're starting a space company, what your logo gonna look like, what colors will you use, what will be your key messaging? There's just so much out there to explore and no one will create something like you will, so just have fun with it.
