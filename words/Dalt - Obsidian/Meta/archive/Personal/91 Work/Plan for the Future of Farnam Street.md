Right now, everything is working as a silo. Not many people from the podcast know we do online courses, but are they supposed to know? I don't think so.

I think the big question to answer is how we best market the courses, the membership, and the books on social and YouTube. This is where we'll get new readers and purchasers from. There already is an ad read in the podcast about the membership, but I think it could be better. Instead of "other member only content," let's say "and access to our exclusive knowledge library that's packed with book summaries, speeches, and other timeless, hard to find resources that will make you smarter. Visit fs.blog/tribe or visit the link in the description to join." *Note: We should do this at the end for YouTube videos as well. Either Shane or someone should say Hey thanks for watching, if you want more of Farnam Street join our membership...*

## Questions
- What stats, company wide, are going to be useful to track?
	- Monthly podcast downloads
	- Typical YouTube growth stuff
	- Course purchases (compare with what we tried for marketing)
		- Via social/YouTube if we can get a separate link as well
	- Typical social growth stuff
	- Monthly website hits (with popular pages)
	- Book purchases
	- Link clicks via podcast description (don't know if that's possible)

## On courses and books via social and YouTube:

The Mental Models course is packed with enough content for us to parse out for a few yearsâ€“here's how I see that being valuable for YouTube and social.

Once a month, we'll produce a special "Mental Models 101" or "Guide to Mental Models" video on YouTube. By starting in the introduction of the course, we can parse out various lectures, add more resources/illustrations and make a 3-5 minute video for YouTube. That video will work as a direct ad for the Mental Models course, with an ad-read at the very beginning and "stay tuned for a discount code at the end" to get 10% off the mental models course with code "FSYouTube."

Since the course is always open, any marketing pushes we do will lead to sales. The more timeless advertising we do (not on social), the longer our efforts will last.

## On Brain Food
There's a massive audience on *Brain Food* that we're not reaching effectively. As far as I know, all we've done to market it is add one link in the bottom of Brain Food for people to sign up using. That's a big ask to make for someone who wanted to some timeless wisdom.

We should instead make a 5-day mini email course on using Mental Models for Better Thinking. Each module can be dedicated to one day and carry the learner through a brief version of using Mental Models. In each email, we make an ask to sign up for the course with a 10% discount with a special code. If we wait and put a discount code at the end, I'm afraid if someone signs up on the third day they'll see the code later and ask for that discount again and I'm not sure how feasible that all is.

One day 6, we send a much longer sales page, similar to the sales page, outlining a specific problem they might find themselves in and explaining how Mental Models can help them be better.

A side benefit of this is that, going forward, we now have an email list of people who are interested in taking courses and we can send more marketing emails to them than just the once a week Brain Food.

Also going forward, each course needs to be developed in a way where its expected to have 5-10 videos made from it and a 5-day email course that launches the day the course launches.

The email course can be used not just for Brain Food, but on social and YouTube as well. It's much more likely someone will put their email down for a free course and convert versus paying $300 right on the spot.

This email list becomes our main marketing channel. Each email can have an ad spot for the Knowledge Library and Membership as well.

## On Social
Our social channels are pretty big, but can utilized much more effectively. Twice/week, we should making our course aware to people. One can be a pretty generic, "hey we have a course." Sometimes those are good.

Another, can be similar to the email course/YouTube, breaking down something specific to the course and teaching it with a read to sign up.

That's all I have thoughts about for the company working better much better together, but here's what I see for Alex to be taking on to free me up to work on the above:

### All I currently do
- Edit and schedule full length podcasts
- Edit and schedule podcast clips
- Film, edit, and schedule article videos
- Edit AMA
- Edit office hours
- Make social posts
- Engage on social
- Course stuff (pretty ambiguous usually but heavy editing when that time comes.)

What Alex can be doing:
- Edit AMAs
- Edit DbD office hours
- First edit of article videos and we can team up to work on graphics.
	- Ideally we watch an article video and break the graphics we want to work on down and set a deadline for the date, adding them when we have them ready.
- Edit AMAs and DbD clips for the Farnam Street YouTube channel
- Pulling quotes and clips for social from past episodes. (ideally 2-3/week)
	- Starting at the first podcast and working down. For each pod have:
		- 2-5 quotes short enough for social media posts (image)
		- 2 - as many as possible clips for YouTube 3-8 mins with waveform, animation, or video. Save these in guest folder.
		- 2 quote clips (:20 - :58) waveform for audio only episodes with Descript template and video for the ones we have video with
		- As many one-liner quotes as said entered into the spreadsheet.
		- For clips and quotes, we can save in guest folder or topic folder. Depending on what we do, we'd name it with the guest/topic so we can easily search. For example, we put Adam Grant clips in Adam Grant folder and name it *Tag:Decision-Making-howToRaiseKids* or in the decision making folder and name it *Adam-Grant-howToRaiseKids*.
		  
		  That way we can easily search by topic or by guest name if looking to promote someone specifically.

I'll still be scheduling all YouTube videos and making thumbnails as well as scheduling all social posts. The rest of my time will be spent on the podcast channel and focused on writing/organizing content from the courses into YouTube videos/social posts/email courses with the assistance of anyone who would like to try.
