## Leadership Course sales page
- Who this course is for:
	- The cubical dweller who wants to lead his team
	- The ambitious college student who wants to start a company
	- The young high schooler who is running for class President.
	- The parent that wants to help run their childs sports program.
	- The part-time Chic Fil A worker who wants to open a franchise someday.
	- The inconsistent manager who is looking to build great relationships and wondering how to maximize the effects of compounding.
	- The introverted leader who doesn't want to be charismatic, but does know how to take charge.
	- The effective leader who has trouble communicating effectively with their team, leading to ambiguity and unnecessary stress for the receiving end of the conversation. 
- Who this course is not for:
	- The satisfied developer who likes to code and has no desire to lead his dev team
	- The middle-manager who keeps blaming his lack of promotion on his boss because they already think they're a perfect leader.
- What is a Leadership Plan?
- Here's the deal, you're probably an okay leader on an average day. But no one wants to be a good leader on an average day, everyone wants to be a great leader in the middle of a crisis.
- Most leadership coaching doesn't work because they only seek it out when the floor is already on fire and their 2 steps away from watching it all crash and burn. It's often too late to fix anything at that point because an object in motion stays in motion - it's much easier to reverse a small snowball than a 6-foot giant.
- Closing the gaps you don't know they have.
- If you see any of these happening in your team, you need to take this course:
	- Plateau
- Be exposed to your blindspots.
- **Features not benefits**
