Best video by retention: Best of 2021
Matthew Walker full episode
Drama Free life - Diana Chapman

Since I changed the Naval thumbnail, the CTR went from 2.2% to 2.6%
On the Naval video, three months after I changed the thumbnail, it got 26,274 views
The three months before I changed the thumbnail it got 18,912 views.

The clips with the highest average view duration (~45%) are the Chamath video about AD and the Ryan Holiday clip that explains why journaling makes you better. Both of these videos had introductions to the idea, b-roll, and felt more like a "YouTube" video than a regular clip did

Esther Perel - Why You're partner Criticizes you 61%

Our notes from our last meeting were:
- To focus on adding more context or a hook to the video. The thinking here was that most YouTube videos explain, "in this video..." and we weren't getting that with the clips.
- When making thumbnails and titles, we wanted to explain the benefits someone would get from watching the videos. (One way I thought about this is "How will this video make you a better person?")
- Refresh thumbnails and titles with older videos to see if we can increase CTR.
- CTR and average view duration are the biggest things to focus on for 2022. We'd rather have one video get 500,000 views than 5 videos get 20,000.

How I implemented these changes:
- I tried two different approaches for the hook. The first was to record a voiceover and create a cinematic intro for the video topic. As I was doing some research, I found out one of the best ways to increase view duration is to immediately answer the thumbnail or title. So the second method was to add a hook that answers the thumbnail and title and people can keep watching for the rest of the context. I used this strategy with the latest Naval clip that had a very high 62.3% retention rate.
- For titles and thumbnails, I typed in the guests name in YouTube to see what autofilled. This gave me insight into what people are searching for in regards to that person. I then used that as a guide to select clips.
- I changed the title and thumbnail of the Naval full-length video. The new thumbnail got a CTR of 2.6%, up from its previous 2.2% CTR. In the three months before I changed the thumbnail, it got ~18,000 views. The three months after I changed the thumbnail it got ~27,000 views. I saw similar results with other episodes I changed.
- With the above changes, the channel CTR has increased by 8% to a CTR of 3.1% and the average view duration is up 33% to 10:33.

My plan for the future is to continue creating clips with the hooks and introductions. We're seeing continuous growth with what we're doing and just need to keep taking more shots. Every one of our videos is averaging more and more views each month and eventually one is going to catch fire.
