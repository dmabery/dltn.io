[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
- "Brief is this existence, as a fleeting visit in a strange house. The path to be pursued is poorly lit by a flickering consciousness." - Einstein #quotes                                           
- The explanation Einstein most often gave for his mental accomplishments was his curiosity. "I have no special talents, I am only passionately curious" - Einstein #quotes #curiosity

[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
- "Every reasonable person must strive to promote moderation and a more objective judgement." - Einstein #quotes 
- "I believe that older people who have scarcely anything to lose ought to be willing to speak out in behalf of those who are young and are subject to much greater restraint." - Einstein #quotes 
- I didn't realize how involved in politics Einstein was. Towards the end of his life, he and many others were facing a suppression of freedom in thought due to Communist fears and supposed "witch hunts" (Einstein's words) from the government to find Communist spies. I draw almost direct parallels to what's happening with today's culture as it did then. Maybe I'm seeing it in light of today's culture and making the connections falsely, but I believe there are some clear parallels to "cancel culture" and what Einstein was dealing with and was so adamant about. At one point, he declared what was happening was similar to what started when the Nazis began taking control of Germany, p.533
	- Though Isaacson later points out that it was nothing close to Nazi Germany, despite Einstein's statements. He was still living peacefully in his Princeton home and didn't fear getting fired or his house being raided. 

# [[02-09-2022]]
[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
- Kurt Godel had a relationship with Einstein toward the end of his years at Princeton. He would explore the relativity theory and its impact on time. Most notably, would argue that if time travel were possible, which in theory he believes it is while still obeying the relativity principle, then time itself is not real.
	- #book - *World Without Time* Yourgrau
- "A theory is more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises, the more different things it relates, and the more expanded its area of applicability" – Einstein 

# [[02-08-2022]]
[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
- One of the core things Einstein loved about America was the ability to have self-expression, and free speech. He said this defined America and wasn't present in Europe, where people were constantly afraid of getting in trouble for having unpopular beliefs.
- Sometime during WW2, Einstein auctioned off a manuscript of his special relativity paper. His assistant read the paper aloud and he re-copied it. "Did I really say it like that? I could have put it much simpler", Einstein complained while copying the original from 1905. p.482
- "I do not know how the Third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they'll use in the Fourth–rocks." - Einstein on the need to govern Atomic power.

# [[02-07-2022]]
[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
- Einstein's problem with quantum mechanics was that he believed there was some universal force, other than what was observable, that was at play in the universe. Bohr's place, his opposer and intellectual sparring partner on the matter, insisted that they could only make judgements about what was indded observable. And if you tried to observe a particle, it would disrupt what it was doing there was no way to calculate or observe it's position and momentuum *at the same exact time.* Because when you measured one, it affected the other.
- Schrodinger's cat was created, in tandem with Einstein, to explain the craziness of quantum mechanics. Quantum theory stated that a nuclei was both decaying and not decaying at the same time until it was observed, which affected its state and it snapped into one or the other. The cat thought experiment shows just how crazy that idea is when brought to the macro world of things.
	- This I don't fully understand. Quantum mechanics, how the cat fits in, and so on. But I'd like to understand it for sure. 		-[[Research inbox]]

# [[02-06-2022]]
[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
-  Einstein was often so absent-minded and lost in thought about whatever problem he was tackling that he would get lost walking home. Or, on one ocassion, was lost in thought at a dinner when the crowd burst into a standing ovation for him but he didn't notice. A friend told him to get up and, thinking it was for someone else, Einstein joined in clapping and cheering along with everyone else. p.439

[[Simply Einstein - Relativity Demystified]]
- [[Gravity]] comes from the Latin word, gravitas–meaning heavy.

[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
- Upon the wake of the German crusading in 1933, Einstein denounced his pacifist motions. As the book states, "Like a good scientist, Einstein could change his mind when confronted with new evidence. By early 1933, with Hitler's ascension, the evidence was clear."


# [[02-04-2022]]
[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
**Chapter 16 & 17**
- Einstein was a radical pacifist
- Einstein's expression of "religious" as he ha fallen into that view after study of the world, nature, and its laws dedeclaring that there is something tangible an inexplicable through it all. p.384 for a good quote
        

# [[02-03-2022]]
[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
**Chapter 15: Unified Field Theories**
- Not much today, actually... Learned about Einstein's caution to accept quantum mechanics based on "reason", something his younger self would have balked at. Other than that, it was more stories about debates with quantum mechanics and into Chapter 16, about his personal life and turning 50

[[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]
## Chapter 14: Nobel Laureate
- Was awarded the prize in [[1921]] for the discovery of the photoelectric effect on not for relativity. This is because too many people didn't think relativity made sense outside of a practical, theoretical manner, but people also believed Einstein should receive the Nobel. A middle ground was reached where he would get the prize for a more concrete discovery of his, with a nod to relativity in the description.
- After he turned 40 in 1919, he got less creative. Part of that had to do with his timidness to defy authority. Before that, there was a direct link in his creativity and to how much he defied authority. But now, he was the authority.
	- He revisited the concept of [[the ether]] and explained the warping of space and time might prove that the ether is indeed comprehensible. But it wasn't ether in the traditional sense, not as in a medium to propagate light waves. Instead, he was reintroducing the idea to explain inertia.
		- "To deny the ether is to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever." Obviously that's not accurate.
- [[Laser is an acronym]]
- As Einstein matured, he firmly believed, contrary to what he believed when he was younger, that there was an objective "reality" that existed whether or not we could observe it.
	- Remember, his whole discovery for [[special theory of relativity]] was based on [[Ernst Mach]]'s strong notion that anything that can't be observed shouldn't be believed. 
- Though Einstein didn't believe in a God that interacted with man, he did believe there was a divine nature to the world and the laws that govern it. With that thought process, he thought it hard to conceive that the creator would have laws govern *some* things in the world, but not all. This was the reason he couldn't get on board with [[quantum mechanics]]. At the time (mid 1920s I think), quantum mechanics believed there was no way to predict or observe the position and momentum of an electron, because in doing so, you would affect the momentum and electron. Einstein had a problem with this and thought there must be a way relativity and quantum mechanics can work together.
- Note: [[Erwin Schrodinger]] is mentioned briefly in this chapter, and I believe this is the groundwork for his famous [[Shrodinger's Cat experiment]], being that once you observe something, you change its nature. But instead of looking at an atom, you're looking at a cat.
