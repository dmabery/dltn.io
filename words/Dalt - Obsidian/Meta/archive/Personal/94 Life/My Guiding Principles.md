- Play chess, not checkers
- Ask more than I tell
- Be curious
- Be less dumb today than I was yesterday
- Compare my progress to who I was yesterday, not to who someone else is today.
- Assume everyone has something to teach me. 
- Aim for the future while you work diligently on the present.      
- Aim to be the person at my father's funeral that everyone can rely on.
- Rather than wish for a life free of struggle, I wish to be strong in the face of adversity.
- Wake up early everyday. Because when I'm up early at my desk before the world wakes up, it makes me feel like my life has a purpose.
- You don't have to be smart to get rich, but you won't stay rich if you're not.
- Chasing merely interesting novelty in an open-ended way. - tagline for #blog #idea 
- Be intrigued by the grandest topics to the humblest questions and everything in between.

## My Life Thesis
Using technology to increase the diffusion of knowledge.

There are certain fundamental truths about how the world works. Physics calls them laws. Philosophies calls them razors. Some people call them mental models. I simply refer to them as *knowledge*. Whatever you decide to cal them, its's an inherent truth that the more you know of them, the better you are to evaluate options, make decisions, and create a life that's filled with meaningful contributions to your family and to the public.

We're living through an elongated period of enlightenment. One where content (yes, content, not knowledge) is easier to publish than ever before. In 1436, Gutenberg's invention of the printing press spurned an intense couple hundred years of knowledge-transfer. The internet did the same thing. Specifically, the internet allowed anyone from Elon Musk to User009493 to put their ideas out into the world and let 'em fly. Consequently, any person was able to see those ideas and relate, debate, or criticize them as they pleased. Unintentionally, this created echo-chambers of knowledge where groups who already know all of the same things were drawn to one another like a magnet in a box of nails. This was a good thing, of course, because people of the fringes of society were able to connect with others. This encouraged those who had niche knowledge to share their wisdom.

But know we're at a turning point. Computers and technology have advanced so far to make our lives easier and more productive, but not make us any smarter. This will be my focus.

Through the intense study of computer science, physics, and history, I want to spend my life increasing the diffusion of knowledge in the world. To increase the access to those fundamental truths about how the world works so anyone can discuss the viability of string theory, debate the interpretation of Reveleation, and find someone who lived in the past whom they wished they'd have met.
