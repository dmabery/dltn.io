Let's say you and I are sitting down for a cup of coffee. Instead of the usual, horrendous chat that is small talk, you ask, "What have you been thinking about lately?" (One of my favorite questions, by the way.) This page is my answer.

- [[The General Theory of Relativity in Simple Terms]]
- [[How record players work]]
- [[What 'Pet Explanations' I subscribe to]]
- [[10 Pending/21 Readwise/Readwise/Books/How We Got to Now]]
- [[Why we look for a car vs. looking for not a car]]
- [[Thinking and working in seasons]]
- [[Einstein's ability to detatch from people helped his creative ideas flourish]]
