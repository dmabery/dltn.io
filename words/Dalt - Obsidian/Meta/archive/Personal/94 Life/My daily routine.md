Since I began working from home in early 2020 and now as a full-time remote employee, I've found my day is defined by the first few hours. It sounds clich√© and typical, but it's true. The days when I wake up and don't know what to work on or slept in later than normal are usually awful. I'm irritable. Cranky. Hungry. It's just no good.

Here is the daily routine I've found that helps me be productive and accomplish all that I wish:

5:00 - Wake and make coffee
5:15 - Read 20 pages or for one hour. Or Write from my #writing-inbox 
6:00 - Wake up Sadie (my pup) and take her outside and feed her
6:30 - Start first deep work session of the day ([[Why I use a legal pad for most notes and tasks]])
9:00 - Make breakfast
9:45 - Second deep work session of the day
12:00 or 1:00 (Depending on my focus) - Lunch and walk with Sadie
2:00 - Make an afternoon cup of coffee
2:15 - Third deep work session of the day
4:15 - Gym or run with Sadie

The thing that I've been struggling with re: my daily routine is working out. I enjoy working out in the morning, after I read, because I feel so fresh and free of mind the rest of the day. However, I've heard someone say once that if the morning hours are your best focus and creative hours, do not waste it on the gym, and that stuck with me.

But I know if I wait to workout in the afternoon, it's a 75/25 chance that I'll actually go because the afternoons are much more volatile than 6:30am.
