## Simple ones to explore sometime:
- Isn't evolution just an opposite version of surviorship bias?
- Where are all the aliens?
	- "Since evolution does not strive for a goal but just happens, it uses the adaptation most useful for a given ecological niche, and the fact that, on Earth, this led to technological intelligence only once so far may suggest that this outcome of natural selection is rare and hence by no means a certain development of the evolution of a tree of life.‚Äù - [[Steven Pinker]] 
	- Makes me wonder... has there ever been a point when evolution went backwards and made the species less intelligent or capable because of some fluke?


## august 2022 update
- Are democratic governments even fighting over problems that democratic governments can fix?

# Questions I have for the universe
- Was there an objective reality that existed whether or not we could ever observe it?
- Were there laws that restored strict causality to phenomena that seemed inherently random?
- Was everything in the universe predetermined?
- When do political parties start being a bad idea?
- Why don't we want the government controlling the internet but we're okay with them controlling our education system?
- How is it that outcomes can be likely and not happen and outcomes can be unlikely and still happen?
- Is a democracy possible in the information age? Or has social media and technology changed the way humans function in a "democracy" and policy hasn't caught up yet?
- Where do jokes come from?
- How many people do I admire that are actually miserable?

# From Morgan Housel
**Who has the right answers** but I ignore because they‚Äôre not articulate?

**What haven‚Äôt I experienced firsthand that leaves me naive to how something works?** As Jeff Immelt said, ‚ÄúEvery job looks easy when you‚Äôre not the one doing it.‚Äù

**Which of my current views would I disagree with** if I were born in a different country or generation?

**What do I desperately want to be true**, so much that I think it‚Äôs true when it‚Äôs clearly not?

**What is a problem that I think only applies to other countries/industries/careers** that will eventually hit me?

**What do I think is true** but is actually just good marketing?

**What looks unsustainable** but is actually a new trend we haven‚Äôt accepted yet?

**What has been true for decades that will stop working**, but will drag along stubborn adherents because it had such a long track record of success?

**Who do I think is smart** but is actually full of it?

**What do I ignore** because it‚Äôs too painful to accept?

**How would my views change if I had 10,000 years of good, apples-to-apples data** on things I only have recent history to study?

**Which of my current views would change** if my incentives were different?

**What are we ignoring today** that will seem shockingly obvious in a year?

**What events very nearly happened** that would have fundamentally changed the world I know if they had occurred?

**How much have things outside of my control** contributed to things I take credit for?

**How do I know** **if I‚Äôm being patient (a skill) or stubborn (a flaw)**? They‚Äôre hard to tell apart without hindsight.

**Who do I look up to** that is secretly miserable?
