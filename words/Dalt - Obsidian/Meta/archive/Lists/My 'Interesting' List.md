- [ ] The dragon story or parable from 12 rules
- [ ] If you hear something in the woods, it's a bear, a big mountain lion, a dangerous murderer, until it's not. But if you keep avoiding looking, it's going to be all of those things. You might, upon review, see that it's just a squirel. But sometimes it is something bad. But now you know exactly what the bad thing is and not faced with 15 other bad options it could have been.
- [ ] If a conversation isn't clearly defined, it will become about everything. And a conversation about everything, is nothing.
- [ ] You can travel and go nowhere at all.
- [ ] Friends want the best for you. You're not morally obliged to be a friend with someone.
- [ ] On comparison: Who cares if you are  the prime minister of Canada if someone else is the President of the United States?
- [ ] Character in "The Cocktail Party" by TS Elliott hopes the misery and suffering she is experiencing is her own fault, because if it is, she might be able to change it. p.155 [[12 Rules For Life]]
- [ ] A natural disaster is an act of God - something you can't predict nor control. But failure to prepare for that disaster you inevitably knew was coming, you must bear the responsibility. p. 157 [[12 Rules For Life]]
- [ ] One of the greatest discoveries of mankind was the understanding of the relationship between what we do now and what happens to us in the future.
- [ ] Losing when you know you didn't do the work is bearable from most people. They don't deserve to win if they didn't do the work. But what's most heart-wrenching, is when you do the work or make the sacrifice and it isn't good enough. That's heartbreaking.<br><br>If you're a boss and an employee doesn't do the work, you can get mad at them. They know it's their fault. But if they did the work and it wasn't in the right way or you just didn't like it, now the situation is much tougher. They have the feeling of success and you have to break them down from their high horse and tell them their sacrifice wasn't good enough. Now they're Cain.
- [ ] Most people are too aware of their own failures and not aware enough of others. This creates a false belief that most people are 10x better than you are.

- [ ] Damaged machinery will continue to malfunction if its problems are neither diagnosed nor fixed.<br><br>Job, marriage, friends, life, it's all working with a system of entropy. As soon as its fixed again, it heads straight for chaos.
- [ ] Compare the gold medal in olympics in one sport in the 50s to the 3rd place medal today. See how crazy human evolution is.
