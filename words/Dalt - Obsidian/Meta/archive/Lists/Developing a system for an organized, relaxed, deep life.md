## Productivity
Weekly and daily plans

Each week: build a weekly plan based on a review of strategic goals, task lists, and value plan

Each day: Review weekly plan and calendar. If it's a weekday, build a time block plan. If not, sketch a looser plan.

Clear work shutdowns: what time will you stop working and what will you do when you're done

Full capture of tasks: At the end of each day, process each of the tasks you've capture into their appropriate systems


## Disciplines
Maintain a strategic plan of core disciplines (behaviors, habits, activities) to follow as strictly as possible that lay a foundation for a deep life. Track with metrics.
