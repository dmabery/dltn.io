An inverse function undos the original function. We can find the inverse function by these steps:

1. Write out the function in terms of x and y.
2. Swap the x and y.
3. Solve for y as a function of x
4. Set y = f-1(x)
5. Plug in the original function into x and see if you get the right answer.

Not all functions have inverse functions. For example, round(x) doesn't have an inverse.

If you graph an inverse function, it will mirror the original graphed function on the 45 degree angle line.
