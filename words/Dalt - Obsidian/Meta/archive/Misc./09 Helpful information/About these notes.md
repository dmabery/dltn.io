## About
No doubt, these notes are kind of strange. So, let's give you (the person inside the file cabinet of my brain) some context.

These notes are mostly written for myself and constitute a rough "thinking environment." However, I'm sharing them in public as an experiment and encouragement for others to think deeply about a wide range of subjects([[Working with the garage door up]]).

Enjoy the musings, Dalton.
