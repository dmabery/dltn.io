There's a lot of junk in this world. Stuffed animals from the carnival, most things from Amazon, cheap bags and clothes from the local farmer's market...I could go on forever.

But some little gadgets are actually quite handy and when used effectively, make life just a little bit more simple. And the more simple your life is, the more time you have to do things you really enjoy.

Here are X things I use around my house that make life just a little bit easier.

### Automatic toothbrush that stops after 2 minutes
Anything that can make your hygenine more effective, you should buy. I've been using this automatic toothbrush for three years now and it's amazing. When you turn it on, it starts operating for two minutes on 30 second intervals. Inbetween each interval is a slight pause, indicating to move to another area of your chompers. After 2 minutes, there's three consecutive pauses letting you know you hit your quota. It's simple. It's effective. And it helps me have cleaner teeth.

### Battery powered jump starter
Your car doesn't need a jump start often, but when it does, you're going to wish you had this guy handy. Instead of phoning a friend or waiting in the parking lot of a store looking like a lost puppy hoping someone will ask if you need a jump, you can just do it yourself.

This charges at home and has cables to connect to the positive and negative terminals on your battery. It's usually good for one jump, but can sometimes do multiple on just one charge. It can fit in your trunk or under the seat with ease and will ensure your stuck waiting for a savior.


### Bombas socks
There's a famous story about the UCLA basketball coach, John Wooden, teaching his players the same thing at the first practice every year. It was how to put on socks and shoes:

> The most important part of your equipment is your shoes and socks. You play on a hard floor. So you must have shoes that fit right. And you must not permit your socks to have wrinkles around the little toe--where you generally get blisters--or around the heels. It took just a few minutes, but I did show my players how I wanted them to do it. Hold up the sock, work it around the little toe area and the heel area so that there are no wrinkles. Smooth it out good. Then hold the sock up while you put the shoe on. And the shoe must be spread apart--not just pulled on the top laces. You tighten it up snugly by each eyelet. Then you tie it. And then you double-tie it so it won't come undone--because I don't want shoes coming untied during practice, or during the game. I don't want that to happen. I'm sure that once I started teaching that many years ago, it did cut down on blisters. It definitely helped. But that's just a little detail that coaches must take advantage of, because it's the little details that make the big things come about.

Since "it's the little details that make the big things come about," it's important to have socks that are comfortable and fit your feet correctly. Bombas socks are the best ones I've found.

### Wirecutter/Reddit/Knowing how to use Google
Knowing where to go for the right information is important. There's a reason that when you Google a companies reviews, Reddit's results are usually in the top five because people are honest and the company can't delete negative reviews.

Reddit is the best place to get unbiased reviews about mainly any company, service, or product. Wirecutter is a reputable site that reccomends which company sells the best type of product. For example if you're looking for a good robot vacumn, you can check Wirecutter to see what they reccomend. The nice thing about their site is that they post their commentary, but also how they performed the tests and the methods that were used. Plus, they always give a "buget" option if you're looking for something a bit less expensive.

### Alarm clock
Having an analog alarm clock does two things.

First, it allows you to put your phone in the other room or out of arms reach while you are sleeping. This will help you not reach for it as soon as the light hits the back of your eyelids.

Second, if you have trouble snoozing, it will help you defeat that. If you put it across the room, you're forced to get out of bed and turn it off. This will help you actually wake up when you said you would. Of course you can always go back to bed, but those few extra seconds of movement might help you think otherwise. It's not a sure fire solution, but it's helpful. I've used this method to wake up at 5:00 am at least 4 days a week for the past few years. 

### Egg cooker
Eggs contain an abundance of protein and nutrients and can be cooked in about a thousand different ways. Getting an egg cooker is an easy way to hard boil a few eggs and have them as a snack or breakfast on the go over the coming days. Shake a little pepper on before each bite and it's like a gourment meal. Delicious. 

### Food thermometer
Half the battle of eating out less is making great food. Half the battle of making great food is knowing when your meat is done or not. No one wants to eat dry anything and no one especially wants to eat *undercooked* anything.
