There's been two articles I've seen recently on the difference between people who ask for what they want (ask culture) vs. people who drop subtle hints at what they want (guess culture). I'm not afraid to admit I fall in the latter group. Does this mean some emotional aspect of my social life is immature or not developed enough?

Some say I'm "easy going" or very "go with the flow" and I'd agree with both of those statements, but it's not because of a big soft spot in my heart to be selfless. Rather, it comes from a deep sense of insecurity of not wanting to inconvenience other people. Don't get me wrong, I do find myself thinking of others a lot, but most of my approach with groups of people, especially groups of people I don't know well, is to ensure other people aren't inconvenienced.

The reason I do that is simple: I know I can handle being inconvenienced. If I really want to go somewhere on a vacation and am unable to ever go though, sure it's a bit sad, but life's still great. I just keep on keepin' on. Others are different. Some people really value seeing certain areas when they're in a new city and would be crushed to not see that thing. Sadness comes first followed me resentment at the people/reasons why they weren't able to see that thing. It's just much easier if I inconvenience myself because I know I can handle it. Is that egotistical? Maybe. A bit stupid? Probably? But does it make sense? In my head, yes.

Part of managing other people's inconvenience's has instilled in me a habit of practicing "guess culture." Guess/Ask Culture is an interesting social phenomenon originally reported on by *The Atlantic*, but recently covered by *Maybe Baby* in an essay. A user named Andrea Donderi posted the following response to someone asking how to get out out of hosting someone at their house for a vacation:

![[https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_dc134bc8-3047-49db-ace8-fd9df306696d_1522x872.webp]]

The ideas are really amazing and surprisingly not very well known. I will say here and now that I am an addicted guesser. I rarely, if ever, put a direct ask into words except to my wife or my best friends. If I get a burger from a restaurant that has mustard on it even though I specifically asked for no mustard, I will not say a thing. I will scrape the mustard off with a knife and enjoy it the best that I can. But if the waiter catches me scrapping off the mustard and asks, "Would you like us to remake it?" I will respond with something along the lines of "If you don't mind." Not a hard yes. Not a direct answer. But yet another "subtle hint" hoping they catch on. I know that I do this. I'm not ashamed.

Obviously that isn't a very deep example and having my meal made wrong is not the worst thing that could happen to me. But those actions play it in other scenarios. If I want a raise, I'm much more likely to bring up the cost of living with my boss, how everything is getting so expensive, or how long I've been at the company for–just hoping they take the bait.

**This is one of the least effective ways to communicate.** It's so hard to get anything done this way! Perhaps this has caused part of the decline in work happiness. It's not the bosses are awful, but that employees are unable to communicate what they need to effectively get their job done. This leads to resentment, contempt, and eventually, quitting.

*Bookbear Express* shared some helpful tips on how to leave guessing behind and become an asker:

Here are my general rules for asking:

-   If it’s very easy for the other person to say no (zero cost to them) and you’ll probably never see them again, ask whatever you want (politely)
    
-   If it’s something like asking someone to hang out, I think it’s okay to ask two times if the person is unresponsive/gives a neutral response. After that, cut your losses.
    
-   If you really, _really_ want to press your case, I would say something like, “Letting you know that I really do want to meet up, and may follow up occasionally to see if you feel the same way. Is that okay?” Do not abuse this (for example, checking in once again after eight months is probably fine, and if they still seem uninterested just drop it).
    
-   Never get upset at someone for saying no. You don’t “deserve” an answer. The truth is, people who don’t know you don’t owe anything to you, and even people who know you really well are free to prioritize themselves (though you may want to rethink the relationship if they don’t seem to care about you, obviously).

My mom was the one who taught me how to be insistent. When I was a kid and she was trying to change a flight reservation or persuade someone to do something she would spend literal hours on the phone—she’d just keep calling back until she found someone who would do it. At the time I found that super embarrassing, as kids do. But looking back, I see that I internalized something important: how to ask for what you want.

To be clear, I don’t mean this in the sense of _you should harass people._ Asking in the wrong way can be bad, and asking when someone’s given you a firm no can be very very bad, so there’s some level of emotional sensitivity required here. But those are the exceptions, since most of the time you are not going to be penalized for asking. You penalize yourself: that’s why you don’t ask. But if you’re able to stop punishing yourself for asserting your needs, something very important changes. You become capable of advocating for yourself. Here are my general rules for asking:

-   If it’s very easy for the other person to say no (zero cost to them) and you’ll probably never see them again, ask whatever you want (politely)
    
-   If it’s something like asking someone to hang out, I think it’s okay to ask two times if the person is unresponsive/gives a neutral response. After that, cut your losses.
    
-   If you really, _really_ want to press your case, I would say something like, “Letting you know that I really do want to meet up, and may follow up occasionally to see if you feel the same way. Is that okay?” Do not abuse this (for example, checking in once again after eight months is probably fine, and if they still seem uninterested just drop it).
    
-   Never get upset at someone for saying no. You don’t “deserve” an answer. The truth is, people who don’t know you don’t owe anything to you, and even people who know you really well are free to prioritize themselves (though you may want to rethink the relationship if they don’t seem to care about you, obviously).
    

This mostly applies to platonic/work situations (romantic/sexual situations are way more fraught and I may dedicate a separate post to them). Other notes:

-   It is generally way more effective to ask a lot of different people than to ask one person many times (they’ve probably made up their mind, unless the situation changes a lot).
    
-   The best cure for rejection sensitivity of any kind is to get rejected a lot.
    
-   When you get a lot of nos and then eventually get a yes, it helps you learn 1) how to get a yes and 2) many narratives you have about yourself are probably mistaken.
    
-   If you are marginalized/less privileged, you will probably receive a lot of more nos. That is wildly unfair and there is no easy solution.
    

I think a lot of people who don’t ask for what they want explicitly end up resenting themselves and resenting the world. I’m speaking from personal experience because I used to be very against asking, and I definitely think it set me back. I have three friends who are incredible askers, and watching them live their lives was what inspired me to change. All three of them share the exact same qualities:

1.  They don’t have much of a filter and freely voice their needs
    
2.  However, they’re not coming at it from a needy place—they’re genuinely super chill and are fine with hearing a no; they’re also good at making people feel like it’s safe to say no to them
    
3.  They’re very warm people (you want to say yes because you like them) and fairly attuned to other people’s needs (they’re giving as well as willing to ask)
    

As a result, I think all three of them have had a lot of success in their work lives, friendships, and romantic relationships. Aspirational, right?

I think the trickiest thing here (it’s been a multi-year journey for me, personally, so I get that it’s difficult) is sort of why PUA stuff exists and all these relationship manuals sell a bazillion copies—it’s really hard to fake security when you’re not secure, and asking just works a lot better if you’re coming from a secure place. However, I think that _practicing asking_ can help you become more secure. So if you want to be more of an asker (this post is inspired by this [Maybe Baby essay](https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/102-no-worries-if-not?s=r) about ask culture vs guess culture, by the way), I would identify low-cost ways to ask and starting practicing those.

One example: I literally used to be unable to tell hairdressers how I wanted to get my hair done. Like, they would suggest giving me bangs (bad, bad, bad, bad) and I would _know I didn’t want that but somehow just go along with it_. Why???? Eventually I realized I was being silly and now I come in with very specific instructions. But I think this kind of scenario is perfect for practicing because obviously this trained professional wants to give you a haircut you don’t hate.

Slightly more difficult: reaching out acquaintances you want to meet up with (for ex, via Twitter). Lots of people are really nice and will oblige you. But also lots of people will ignore you, and that’s okay too!

Truly difficult: being honest about your needs in important relationships (friendships, partners, etc). I think like 85% of people just absolutely can’t do this, so if you can, kudos to you.

Anyway, living a fulfilling life aside, asking is good because it saves you _time_. It’s amazing to me how many people find roundabout ways to lightly hint at what they want when they probably could’ve saved themselves hours and hours by just asking directly. You may think your hints are super obvious, but most people are not paying as much attention to you as you think they are. If you really, really want to know what the answer is, just ask.

Asking also makes you better at _answering_ questions. People who are indirect often end up being dishonest just because they’re so uncomfortable with the prospect of saying no. Examples: buying something you don’t want, ghosting someone after a third date, lying when you are definitely not planning to hang out with someone again. Obviously, it’s good to be tactful, but I think most people would benefit from being significantly more direct.

Directness is a gateway drug to emotional honesty. That’s my take, anyway. I’m curious what you think: are you an asker or a guesser? Do you want to be more direct, or do you think subtle hints are underrated? Do you feel like you usually get the answers you want to hear?

Good morning!

A couple months ago I learned something from a random internet thread that I’ve recounted to several people since. Today I finally decided to write about it!

### **No worries if not**

Last week I advised my sister to remove two exclamation points from a text message she was crafting. They made her seem happy that someone was flaking on her, I told her, and I thought it was okay if she seemed disappointed, which she was. This made her sweat. “But I don’t want him to think I’m upset,” she said. But you are, I replied. “But I don’t know if I have the right to be,” she said. “Maybe I wasn’t clear enough with him last week when we started the conversation.” We went on like this for a while, before compromising on one exclamation point and one period. We were laughing by then, because the entire exchange—ours, theirs—was overwrought and ridiculous. This is communication when you’re neurotic: icebergs of meaning lurking beneath quick turns of phrase or single exclamation points.

My sister is a dyed-in-the-wool non-confrontationist, but she also has high expectations. This makes her a model subject of the “no worries if not” meme—a running joke on Twitter that pokes fun at people who use the verbal tick in inappropriate situations and a phenomenon I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. As in: “Any chance you could treat me with decency and respect? No worries if not!” Almost always the tweets are self-deprecating: Everyone’s making fun of themselves for being [so accommodating](https://twitter.com/fiona_wilsonx/status/1531601922435719172), so [socially anxious](https://twitter.com/rosalyster/status/1296817798447017984), so unable [to ask for what they need](https://twitter.com/rachel_kaly/status/1316581653465174017). Last year, the viral phrase inspired a [Daily Shouts column](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/no-worries-if-not?source=search_google_dsa_paid&gclid=CjwKCAjwv-GUBhAzEiwASUMm4pBeFSmyia-LPiOveenctyEODnCZHUyGRFYzPqmNyiqxY0R_rCwkghoC5DkQAvD_BwE): “Hiya!” greeted a cartoon woman dangling from a ledge. “I’m currently holding on for dear life and surely moments away from a gruesome death, so I will need confirmation on this ASAP as my demise is imminent. No worries if not, though!”

“No worries if not” has lost its meaning to the point of signaling its opposite, which is why the joke is funny, or was once funny (sorry to explain it). If originally the expression was used to clarify the stakes of a question, now it’s used to manipulate them. “Any chance you can feed the cat while I’m out? No worries if not!” By pretending the stakes are lower than they are, we inoculate ourselves against the embarrassment of having needs, or appearing to care if we’re rejected. It’s a pressure valve, but a palliative one; after all, the stakes haven’t actually changed. I think this is a pretty good metaphor for what happens when we become socialized to the point of incoherence: everyone neurotic, everything symbolic. I’ve been referring to this casually as _oversocialization_. Unfortunately, I recently realized I picked that term up from the [Unabomber Manifesto](https://www.economica.id/2019/05/10/kajian-online-over-socialization-is-social-media-killing-your-individuality). I think it tracks though.

A few months ago, while reading an old MetaFiler thread on what it actually means to be “earnest,” which I was considering writing about, a [user named Stacey](https://ask.metafilter.com/340905/Importance-Of-Being#:~:text=I%20don%27t%20think%20Earnestness%20generally%20actually%20maps%20onto%20good%20old%20Ask/Guess%20culture%20in%20a%20direct%20way%2C%20but%20to%20an%20extent%20with%20my%20specific%20friends%20Earnestness%20and%20Ask%2Dness%20seem%20to%20have%20some%20overlap.) name-checked something called “Ask/Guess culture” as if the reference were widely known. “I don't think earnestness generally actually maps onto good-old Ask/Guess culture in a direct way,” she wrote, “but to an extent with my specific friends, earnestness and ask-ness seem to have some overlap.” I had no idea what she was talking about, so I Googled it. The results returned a spate of media coverage from 2010 (_[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/340891/)_, _[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser)_), all of which linked back to a _different_ MetaFilter comment by a user named Andrea Donderi. It was in response to a question about how to get out of hosting an out-of-towner who’d asked to stay over, and [her reply](https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20classic%20case%20of%20Ask%20Culture%20meets%20Guess%20Culture.) had briefly gone viral: 

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc134bc8-3047-49db-ace8-fd9df306696d_1522x872.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc134bc8-3047-49db-ace8-fd9df306696d_1522x872.png)

Reading it, I was surprised the terms “asker” and “guesser” weren’t more widely known or used today, seeing as social nomenclature has hit peak interest. But no one I mentioned Ask/Guess culture to had heard of it, and everyone was intrigued as I was. The dichotomy explained a lot. Namely, to us, that we were guessers (mostly), which was making communication more complicated than it needed to be. Wouldn’t it be nice, we agreed, to simply ask for what we wanted in a straightforward way, and accept the answer without expectation? The sales pitch for Guess culture is that it’s more conscientious and considerate, but isn’t it equally true that by padding everything with caveats and easy outs, we assume people aren’t capable of asking or answering a yes or no question, of handling or expressing the truth?

Still, it’s hard to unlearn that sort of thing. Etiquette embeds in your psyche until it resembles logic. To a guesser, it may seem necessarily and universally true that, say, asking to borrow a friend’s new car is putting them in an awkward position. But these ideas are defined by culture, by cohort. Per _[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/340891/)_ [piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/340891/), “Brits and Americans get discombobulated doing business in Japan, because it's a Guess culture, yet experience Russians as rude, because they're diehard Askers.” Americans aren’t a monolith either. A rich white woman from the Upper East Side will communicate her desires differently from a black working class guy from the Bronx, and they’re nearly neighbors. Neurodivergence is relevant here, too: People on the Autism spectrum, for example, are [generally more direct](https://laconciergepsychologist.com/blog/autism-communication/), and in Guess cultures, are often deemed “anti-social” as a result. In different environments, they may not be.

The limits of Guess culture are perfectly illustrated by the “no worries if not” meme. Like “no pressure,” or “I’m fine either way,” the phrase is an indirect attempt to harness the freedom of Ask culture. We want to ask questions without knowing the answers, like askers, only without the incumbent risk. This loophole works fine enough until the question isn’t actually low-stakes—try to avert risk then and you just sound ridiculous, stumbling through so many qualifiers your needs are doubly obscured, sometimes even to yourself. When directness is scandalized to this extent—when “no worries if not” means, literally, “worries if not”—communication becomes opaque and lawless, like a foreign language composed entirely of irregular verbs.

As a guesser actively trying to learn to be an asker, or somewhere in-between, I’ve been surprised by how many social interactions I’ve observed that seem to hinge on the Ask/Guess framework, whether they concern a favor or not. To return to the texts, my sister was irritated with her friend, but she didn’t want him to know just in case he had a valid case against her irritation, which might irritate _him_, which could make her feel bad or cause conflict. The prize for her guesswork was keeping the peace. The cost was mutual understanding. The process was debating over an exclamation point, repressing everything else. I recognized what she was doing because I’ve done it myself. (I wrote about this a little bit in [#95: Are you a baby? A litmus test.](https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/95-are-you-baby-a-litmus-test?s=w))

I still think there’s merit to Guess culture. My sister’s affinity for it is part of why I see her as an incredibly thoughtful person. Some conflicts actually _are_ worth avoiding, and some feelings are worth tending to. But I think it’s also useful to understand how guessing can be a buffer against vulnerability, infringing on human connection and understanding, infantilizing us. As self-awareness and social performance become supercharged by mass media, the risk of keeping the peace this way is that we become detached from our own fates. It’s easy to rebrand these complicated social dances as consideration or even politeness, but probably more honest to recognize how often they concern the self: perception, protection.

It makes sense to me that “no worries if not” is largely a millennial refrain. It’s a cowed expression. In many ways, we’ve been cowed by orthodoxy, by decorum, by the way things have always been done, even if they don’t actually work for anyone anymore. This is the darker comedy of the meme, and possibly the optimism of it.
