Notion and Obsidian have seem to have both risen to the top of the personal knowledge management/productivity guru's list. Of course there are other great options out there to take notes, but Notion and Obsidian are the two that I see recommended the most "out in the wild."

So, that begs the question, which is actually better?

Like most things in life, there is a nuanced answer. If you're really organized, love structure, prefer for things to work exactly how they are supposed to and are a big fan of aesethics and you would define yourself as an architect, then Notion is better for you.

If you're okay with a little bit of uncertainty, enjoy a bit more flexibility with plugins, setting up custom workspaces, and are okay doing a bit of hacking, and would consider yourself a gardener, then Obsidian is for you.

I used the terms architect and gardener in the descriptions for each and if you're not sure what those are, stick with me here. In 2020, when the note-taking/PKM world really took off thanks to certain apps and communities, Anne-Laure wrote a brilliant article aimed at helping people choose their preferred note taking app. In it, she defined a few terms that categorizes certain ways people take notes.

Gardner, architect, etc., here.
