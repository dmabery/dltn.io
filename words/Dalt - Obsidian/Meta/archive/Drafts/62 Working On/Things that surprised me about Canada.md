#idea I recently travelled to Ottawa, and Canada in general, for the first time. Here are some things that surprised me or I found to be noteworthy:

- "Restrooms" are called "washrooms."
- They call one dollar coins "looneys" and two dollar coins "twooneys."
- A lot of the architecture is very old European style. I guess it makes sense that it looks like this, but 'twas surprising nonetheless. 
- During elections, they vote for parties and not people.
- A centrist in Canada will be on the left in America. The center in America and the center in Canada are not the same, though people assume that they are.
- There was midwest level humidity one day.
- During the winter, the canal freezes over and people ice skate all over the canal.
- There was a tornado warning.
