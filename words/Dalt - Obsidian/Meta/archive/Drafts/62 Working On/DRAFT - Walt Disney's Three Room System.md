### Reflections on Walt Disney
http://reflectionsonwalt.blogspot.com/2014/05/walts-3-minds-and-3-rooms.html

Is there a recipe for being creative?
Disney's "Nine Old Men"
Oliver Johnson
Ollie commented on Walt saying there were actually three of him and you never knew which one was coming to the meeting:
	Dreamer
	Realist
	Critic
Room 1 - Brainstorming
	All ideas presented here. No naysaying allowed
	If I could wave a magic wand, what would I create?
	**WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO**
Room 2 - Storyboarding and sketches
	How can I make this happen?
	Can I extract the principle of the idea?
	During this phase, seek to resolve every uncertainty around timing, logistics, and feasibility. When something doesnâ€™t make sense, question it.
	**HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT**
Room 3 - Putting the project under the microscope. "Sweatbox"
	Is this the best we can do?
	How can we make it better
	What does this look like to a client, a customer, an expert, and outsider?
	
	**WHY ARE WE DOING THIS**
