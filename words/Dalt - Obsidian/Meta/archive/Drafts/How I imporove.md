After I graduated high school, I enrolled in an internship program at a local church. The program was split into three tracks: leadership, worship, and production. I can't sing, so I chose leadership. I had a lot of friends in the worship track and they'd always be practicing their scales. Over and over and over again they'd go up and down the piano or guitar practicing the same simple notes.

I remember thinking at the time, *how can I practice my leadership skills?* As far as I can remember, the only "practice" I had was reading leadership books, but that wasn't the same. If a  worship student read all of the piano books in the world, but never touched a piano, they'd still suck. I was leading a small group every week, so I guess that counted. But I was looking for something to do in the wee hours of the morning or the quiet hours at night. Something I could do for 15 or 20 minutes day that let me really practice becoming a great leader.

I found nothing.

To the bewilderment of my own, no one else seemed to understand what exactly I was asking. I was so confused. I found it preposterous that these worship kids had a clear cut way to practice, and those of us in leadership had nothing.
