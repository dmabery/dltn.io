Instead of trying to write an article *after* I've been there for awhile or have seen a bit of success, write about it in detail now.

- What I thought when I first got hired.
- What was my approach going to?
- What were the problems I was trying to solve?
- What would success look like/how would I know I was on the right track?
- What was going to be my game plan?
- Why did I create the scenes?
- Why did we kill the clips channel?
- Thinking about how to make them more engaging, like a native YouTube video, instead of a podcast clip - how could I accomplish this?
- I was struggling with the "Mr. Best style vids work on YouTube" and "That's not the content I was creating."
	- Would be cool to do two separate circles and then come together as a venn diagram to show what things I thought would work. Are those working?
- Where am I at in the process now? Have we seen success? If so, are we doubling down/iterating on that?
