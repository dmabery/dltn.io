	- You read abstractions of people's ideas and their lessons. You are the cook and not the chef. Earned abstraction vs learned abstraction. When things go wrong, you don't know what to do. This is what's wrong when you read bugs from Stack Overflow. When you copy and paste it works, but if there is an error or something, you're not sure how to troubleshoot.

## Theories


## Misc.
- **Before I die, I hope to glimpse this comprehensive perspective, from which every event and discovery is placed in historical continuity, illuminated through scientific understanding, elevated by philosophical analysis, and softened with literary sympathy.** 


## Curiosity
- "Be a loner. That gives you time to wonder, to search for the truth. Have holy curiosity. Make your life worth living." - Albert Einstein


## Education
- "Teachers should prepare the student for the student's future, not for the teacher's past." – Richard Hamming



## History
- "It's an unnerving thought that we may be the living universe's supreme achievement and its worst nightmare simultaneously.


## Life
- “Every problem, every dilemma, every dead end we find ourselves facing in life, only appears unsolvable inside a particular frame or point of view. Enlarge the box, or create another frame around the data, and problems vanish, while new opportunities appear.” - **Benjamin Zander 
- “I would rather have questions that can’t be answered than answers that can’t be questioned.” - [[Richard Feynman]]
- “There are limitless opportunities open to the man who appreciates the fact that his own mind is the sole key that unlocks them.” - Rocket Man, David Clary
- I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain one's self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live simply and wisely. - [[Henry David Thoreau]]
- Neglect is often the worst thing that can happen to something: "As with so many of the libraries we will meet in this book [The Library], neglect was a much more potent enemy than war or malice.""
- "You must have the courage to leave the table if respect is no longer being served."
- You can choose two:
	- Work
	- Family
	- Scene
- Predicting rain doesn't count; building arks does. (Noah's rule? I don't know who this is attributed to, but it's great.)
- “I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see.” – John Burroughs

## Philosophy
- What is a man in the midst of infinity? – Pascal
- [[Einstein]] - Only those who themselves have wandered lost, wrote Einstein, know the misery and joy of "the years of searching in the dark for a truth that one feels but cannot express; the intense desire and the alternations of confidence and misgiving, until one breaks through to clarity and understanding."

## Reading/books
- "Literature is art married to thought"
-  A book is a heart that only beats in the chest of another.

## Science
- A scientist is happy, not in resting on his attainments but in the steady acquisition of fresh knowledge.~[[Max Planck]]
- Every living thing is an elaboration on a single original plan. As humans, we are mere increments–each of us a musty archive of adjustments, adaptations, modifications, and providential tinkerings stretching back 3.8billion years.
- God was a mathematician, seventeenth-century scientists firmly believed. He had written His laws in a mathematical code. Their task was to find the key. 
- "Scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for the exploration of the unknown." – Vannevar Bush

## Stories
- In 1611, ScotsCare was a charity founded to improve the lives of Scottish Londoners. At the time, many Scots in London were deprived of basic needs and it was difficult to get assistance. But now, some 400 years later, London is the richest city in the UK and Scots in London are doing just fine, while Scots in different parts of Scotland are not doing very well.
	- This illustrates the importance of making values important and not just policies. It also shows what can happen when you approach a problem with a too narrow minded solution.

## Strategy
- "The way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death" - Miyamoto Musashi, "The Book of Five Rings"
- "I'm not in the music business. I'm in the Iron F***** Maiden business" – Iron Maiden's manager when someone asked him what it's like being in the music business.

## Writing
- "Any one may mouth out a passage with a theatrical cadence, or get upon stilts to tell his thoughts: but to write or speak with propriety and simplicity is a more difficult task." – William Hazlitt
- "Besides reading, a young person ought to write, if they have the capacity and leisure. If you wish to remember a thing well, put it into writing, even if you burn the paper after you have done so; for the eye greatly assists the mind." – William Cobbett
