If you burn 1,000 calories everyday working out, but then go home and eat 2,000 calories, you'll never actually lose weight.

The same is true for wealth-building. If your income is increasing but so is your spending, you will never build wealth.

**Wealth is what you don't spend.**
**Building wealth is often an invisible process, so it's hard to observe what others are doing and follow them.**
**Wealth building is a negative art, so it's more often about what you *don't* spend than what you do spend.**
