- Behaviors are always a better option than supplements because they rewire your nervous system. You learn how to fall asleep better by forcing yourself to use tricks and routines. Supplements help, but if you stop taking the supplement then you stop getting the effects. 
- The temperature system in your body is very counter-intuitive. If you're hot from a run and put an ice pack on your neck, it's like putting an ice pack on a thermostat - it's going to send signals to warm your body up. Similarly, if you get into a Sauna or a hot shower, it's going to tell your body to cool down. That's good at night because you want your body temperature to be lower when trying to go to sleep.
- Hypothesis: Every hour of sleep before midnight recharges more than the hours after midnight. This isn't proven, it's just a hypothesis and question.
- Caffeine is designed to get us into the mode of achieving things that have no direct reward. In other words, it helps create 'motivation' ([[Discipline will only take you so far]], [[Motivation is a myth]]) to get you to do things that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do.
- You have to be relaxed to be able to have situational awareness. The moment you get adrenaline pumping, your field of vision narrows.
	- Also, space and time are linked within the visual system of your brain. So when you're stressed and have a really narrow field of vision, then time will feel slow because you're micro-dicing the contexts.
