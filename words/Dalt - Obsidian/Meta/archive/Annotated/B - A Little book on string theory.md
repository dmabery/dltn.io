## Summary

## Notes
## 1.) Energy
- Length - We know what this is
- Time - A fourth-dimension. You can move any direction in space, but not in time. [[*Time Dilation*]]
- Mass - Most of the mass is in protons and neutrons and a bit of electrons. Mass is different than weight, because weight has to do with gravitational pull. Basically, this comes down to saying how many nucleons are in an object.
- Particles whirling around particle accelerators experience tremendous time dilation - time runs about 1000 times slower than for a proton at rest.
- Energy of motion is called [[kinetic energy]]. 
- E=mc2 refers to rest energy. Rest energy is the energy in matter when it is not moving. When you run, you're converting little of your rest energy into kinetic energy. About 10^15. Consequently, you experience the same amount, 10^15 in time dilation. [[special theory of relativity]] includes a precise relation between time dilation and kinetic energy. If something is moving fast enough to double its energy, then its time runs half as fast as it would if it weren't moving. 
- Tighter binding in an atom means less mass.
- Nuclear fission releases energy as protons and neutrons settle into slightly more compact arrangements. (Tighter binding, heavier mass, more energy to give off.)

## 2.) Quantum Mechanics
- Preferred motions are called quantum states. They have a definite frequency. A frequency is the number of times something cycles or repeats. In quantum mechanics, the thing that cycles if the phase of the wave function. 
- If two large objects collide head on and they both stop after, they had equal momentum before the collision. If one is moving in the direction it was going, but slower, it had more momentum.
- [[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]] - Delta p(uncertainty in momentum) X Delta x(uncertainty in length) is no less than h ([[Planck's Constant]]) over 4 Pi.
	- So you can measure position and momentum simultaneously, but the uncertainty in those two measurements can never be smaller than what the equation above allows.
	- *The product of the uncertainties in a particle's momentum and position is never less than Planck's constant divided by 4 Pi.*
-  An electron is trapped by its attraction to the nucleus, but it does not stay still. It wanders all about in a way that the math of QM describes. This wandering gives the atom its size. If it stopped wandering, it would be at rest in the nucleus and all matter would shrink to zero. 
- Though the momentum and position of an electron is uncertain, the energy of that electron can be defined. Its energy is quantized (the discrete packets Einstein talked about). When the electron jumps down from one energy level to another, then it sheds the excess energy by emitting a photon. The photon's energy is the difference between the electron's energy before the jump and after the jump.
- An FM radio is constructed so that electrons oscillate at just about the frequency you can tune it. (107.1 broadcasts at 107.1 megahertz). The electrons inside the radio soaked up the radio waves that wash over the radio. [[How radios work]]
	- *Is this why we can only have certain radio stations? Because light waves can't choose to be at random frequencies, they have to be at certain lengths because of how the photons get emitted when they jump an energy level?* [[Light quanta]]
- Brightness refers to how many photons there are. The color of the light determines the energy of each photon. So a brighter light can have less energy than a dimmer one, if its photons have less energy than the dimmer photons.
- The rest energy of a photon is zero, so we must conclude that a photon has no mass. 

## 3.) Gravity and Black Holes
- When a gravity wave(a wave of gravitons that act similarly to photons but can't be seen) passes between two objects, the distance between them fluctuates. That's because the spacetime between them actually fluctuate. This is how we aim to measure gravitational radiation.
- Special relativity - time slows down for those who are moving
- General relativity - time slows down for those who are in a stronger field of gravity
- You can't make something colder than -459.67 degrees F., because there's no thermal energy left to suck out of it - the molecules are completely still (as much as quantum uncertainty allows them to be of course).

## 4.) String theory
- The starting assumption of string theory is that particles are not points, but vibrational modes of strings.
