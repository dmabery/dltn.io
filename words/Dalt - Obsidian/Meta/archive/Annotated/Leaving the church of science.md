[[Gettier problems explain that knowledge is much more than justified belief]]

### Knowledge can be put on a spectrum with math on one side and faith on the other. The more "science" conducted around that topic, the more the belief moves from faith edge to math-y edge.

> What about science? Where does science land on the Faith to Math spectrum?
>
> I’d argue that Science is the process of moving beliefs along the Faith - Math spectrum. It adds explanatory power to our various beliefs so we have knowledge closer to Math to hang those beliefs on and do not need to rely as much on Faith. There is still an element of Faith involved, but the more science we do around an idea, the more Math-y we should feel about it.

### [[The Scientific Method]] doesn't prove anything - it just *fails to falsify it*

> It's important to highlight the difference between falsification and proof. **The scientific method does not prove anything. It only fails to falsify.** We often think of "failing to falsify" and "proving" as the same thing, but they're very different in a very important way. When we say a drug is “safe,” what we’re really saying is that we haven’t found any meaningful ways in which it is harmful.

> There's nothing wrong with the scientific method. But there is something wrong with assuming all science is done to the highest standards, and with assuming everyone reporting on science knows what they're talking about and is free of their own biases.

> History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. We trusted the Scientific Method, we trusted Scientists to use the methodology fairly, and we trusted our authorities to accurately disseminate the discoveries of those experts. We couldn't read, so we did the best we could. But now that we can read, we're realizing the Church might have lied about some stuff, and while most Bishops were dutifully trying to interpret the word of God, others were stealing our money and touching our kids.


### Political lines are no longer Dems vs Reps., its authoritarian v. populist

> Our political lines are no longer Democrat vs. Republican. They're Authoritarian vs. Populist.

> You have one demographic that thinks they know best for everyone else. They interpret the science, they decide what you learn, they decide how you eat, they decide what hashtags go in the Twitter bio this week.
> 
> And you have another demographic that's getting sick of being told what to do. Sick of being told they're too dumb to think for themselves. Sick of being mischaracterized as idiots for asking questions.
