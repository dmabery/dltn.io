# B - A Brief History of Time

## Notes

### 1.) A picture of our universe
- First, we had the sphere model of the earth. (as also read about in [[ðŸ“š The Invention of Science]].)
- Then, we had [[Copernicus']] model of the universe come along. Almost a century passed before this view became appreciated, thanks to Galileo and Kepler. The measurements of Copernicus's model wasn't exactly what was observed, but it was close. Galileo first observed the moons of Jupiter orbiting Jupiter, which meant not everything orbited around the earth. Then, Kepler proposed that planets orbit not in a circle but in an ellipse. This slight modification to Copernicus' theory helped it match the observations. 
- The Big Bang theory really came into question when, in 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] observed galaxies were rapidly moving away from us. This meant, that at some point in time, everything was at one location, infinitely small and infinitely dense. Here, all the laws of science and the universe would break down. If we had no laws of science here, we would not have been able to predict the future because we can only know the future based on predictions that are founded in the laws of the universe.
- A theory can never be proved, but can be disproved with only a shred of evidence that goes against the predictions said theory makes. A good theory makes a number of predictions that could be disproved by certain observations. "Each time new experiments are observed to agree with the predictions the theory survives, and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found to disagree, we have to abandon or modify the theory."
-  "The eventual goal of science is to provide a single theory that describes the whole universe." But this problem comes with two parts: First, there are the laws that tell us how the universe changes with time. If we know what the universe is like at one time, these laws tell us what it will look like at a later time. The second part is the initial state of the universe. If there are laws governing its current state, it's safe to assume there are laws governing the initial state.
  
  How we've gone about this currently, is to separate each problem into its own bit of information, trying to create and combine many small theories into one larger theoryâ€“the theory of everything. It's very hard to do it all in one go. But if everything is dependent on everything else, this may not be the best way to do it. Either way, it's worked well so far. 
  
  Today, the closest thing we have are two partial theoriesâ€“the general theory of relativity (which relates to the normal and large) and quantum mechanics (which relates to the very, very small). Interestingly, these theories do not play nicely with each other. Einstein devoted his life to figuring these two things out after his discovery of Relativity and was not able to do so. 
- Why are we doing any of this? Because, "Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in."

### 2.) Space and Time


### 3.) The Expanding Universe
- Our modern view of the universe can be dated back to 1924, when Hubble proposed we were not the only galaxy in the universe.
- If other galaxies are red-shifted and moving away from us, doesn't that mean we are at the center of the universe? If not, are we on the edge of the universe? Or somewhere where there are more galaxies "in front" of us moving away from us than there are "behind" us moving away from us?
- The noise heard by Penzais and Wilson were the light rays from the early universe. They had been stretched so far that they were red shifted - turning them into microwaves.
- There are three models for an expanding universe:
	- First, the universe is expanding very slowly and the gravity between the galaxies will eventually cause the expansion to stop. Then, the galaxies move towards each other and the universe collapses. *Perhaps this collapse from a past bang is what caused our big bang?*
	- Second, the universe is expanding so rapidly that the gravity can't stop it, it just slows it down.
	- Third, the universe is expanding just fast enough to avoid recollapse. It starts at zero and increases forever, though the rate at which it expands gets just a bit slower over time.
	- **The model our universe is in** is probably the second or third. Just by measuring the matter in the universe we can see (including dark matter), it's nowhere near dense enough to stop the expansion rate of the universe, which is 5% to 10% every thousand million years. 
- Either way, all the solutions say that at some point in the past (around ten and twenty thousand million years ago) the distance between galaxies were zero. At that time (The Big Bang), the density of the universe and the curvature of space-time would have been infinite. Since math doesn't compute well with infinite numbers, relativity and all our other laws of physics breaks down. So even if something did happen before the Big Bang, we couldn't use any of that to predict what might happen after because the buck stops with the Big Bang. This is also how "time" had a beginning - for anything that happened before the Big Bang, if there was anything at all, won't have any consequences after the Big Bang, so it's removed from the model of how the universe works. 
- Roger Penrose, in 1965, concluded that any star collapsing under its own gravity would turn into a black hole singularity. Hawkins reversed that principle, and showed that any *expanding* universe must have *started* from a singularity, when all its matter and volume was densely packed and near zero. 

### 4.) The Uncertainty Principle
- [[Light quanta]], determined by Planck and later Einstein, explained that electromagnetic waves can only be dealt in discrete packets, or determined intervals of energy. (They are also called a [[photon]]). You can't have 2.5 quanta. Quanta
	- [[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]] - When looking at an electron under a microscope, we use light. The photons, or light quanta in the light, bounce off the particle and move it around. So we cannot know the position and the direction of a particle at the same time.
- The uncertainty principle rid Laplace's determinism ideas because there's no way we can predict the future if we can't even the predict the current state of things accurately. 
	- This applies to many other things in life as well - you cannot observe things without disturbing it. This may be why focus groups and micro-managers don't work very well. 
- The discovery of the uncertainty principle led to quantum mechanics - where particles no longer have definite positions and velocities. Instead, they had a quantum state, which was a combination of position and velocity.
- Classical theory or classical mechanics means a theory that does not take into account the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. 
	- General Relativity is a classical theory. It does not lead to any discrepancies because the gravitational fields we encounter everyday are very weak. In strong gravitational fields (black holes and the big bang) understanding quantum mechanics is very important and therefore, General Relativity breaks down. 

### 5.) Elementary Particles and The Forces of Nature
- The word *atom* means indivisible in Greek.
- Quarks > Atoms (protons, electrons, neutrons) > Molecules (multiple atoms with electrons orbiting different nuclei)
- Quarks were discovered by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] [[Gell-Man Amnesia]]
	- There are six flavors
		- Up, down, strange, charmed, bottom, and top.
		- Each flavor comes in three colors: red, green, and blue.
	- A proton or neutron is made up of three quarks, one of each color. Proton contains two up quarks and one down quark. A neutron contains two down and one up. We can create particles of other quarks, but they decay rapidly and soon become a proton or neutron.
	- Neither the atoms, nor the protons or neutrons are indivisible. 
- All particles have a property called spin - this tells us what a particle looks like from different directions.
	- Spin 0 - The particle looks the same from all directions
	- Spin 1 - Looks different from different directions
	- Spin 2 - Looks the same if one turns it round 180 degrees.
	- Spin .5 - You have to turn this particle through two complete revolutions to get it to look the same.
- Force-carrying particles (still unsure what these are really) can be grouped into four categories:
	- Stopped reading here - moved to black holes

### 6.) Black holes
- A star is formed when large amounts of gas (mostly hydrogen) starts to collapse on in itself to its gravitational attraction. As that happens, the atoms of the gas collide with each other more and more frequently, which causes the gas to heat up. Eventually, the gas becomes so hot that when they hydrogen atoms collide, they combine with each other instead of bounce off each other, forming helium. The heat released in this reaction is what makes the star shine.
	- The pressure from the gas builds until it counteracts the gravitational pull of the gas - balancing out the reaction. It will stay stable like this until it runs out of fuel (gas) and starts contracting.
	- What happens when it runs out of gas is two things:
		- It can either support itself from the exclusion principle because when the star collapses, it gets very small and the matter particles get very close together, according to Pauli's exclusion principle, the particles must have different velocities, which makes them move away from each other and the star expands. So a star, once it runs out of fuel, can balance itself through the expansion of particles acting against the attraction of gravity.
		- However, the general theory of relativity limits the maximum difference between the speed of particles to the speed of light, so there is a limit to big of a star this process can work on. Chandrasekhar calculated that any star more than about one and half times the mass of the sun would not be able to support itself against its own gravity.
- The Event Horizon in a black hole is the path through space-time that light is trying to escape from the black hole, and nothing can travel faster than light. Since  nothing can travel faster than light, and light can't escape it, neither can anything else.  
- General Relativity predicts that heavy objects that are moving will cause the emission of gravitational waves. These carry energy away from the object that emits them. So two stars orbiting each other lose energy from the gravitational waves they emit. Eventually, they'll lose enough energy that they will collide with each other.
- A black hole's size and shape depends only on its mass and its rate of rotation. It has nothing to do with the body that formed it. This means that any information about an object that formed a black hole is lost once the black hole is formed, because at that point the shape and size only depends on its mass and rate of rotation. 

### 7.) Black holes ain't so black
- One premise of the second law of thermodynamics (entropy), is that when two systems are joined together, the entropy of the combined system is greater than the sum of the entropies of the individual systems. [[Two systems combined have more disorder than either system together]]

### 8.) The Origin and Fate of the Universe
- A lot of good information from 119 - 126; would be good to summarize all of this.
- God could have created the initial configurations of the universe in a way that we could not hope to understand â€“ which would well be in the bounds of an Omnipotent being. But this makes one ask if he did that, why did he let it evolve in a way that we *could* understand.
- Could it be we are living in a section of the universe that just so happens to be smooth and orderly? It seems ridiculous to say, because that configuration of the universe would be so outnumbered by a chaotic version of the universe, but it is possible.
	- *Perhaps the smoothness of the universe is [[The Great Filter]]*
- [[Anthropic principle]] - We see the universe the way it is because we exist.
	- Weak anthropic principle states that in a universe that is large or infinite in space and time, the conditions necessary for the development of intelligent life will be met only in certain regions that are limited in space and time. Therefore, it shouldn't be a surprise to those living in these regions that the area in which they inhabit the universe are the precise conditions which they need for their eventual existence.
	- Strong anthropic principles states that there are many different universes or many different regions of a single universe, each with its own configuration and own laws of science. Only in certain regions of this universe would beings exist that were capable of questioning why the universe is the way it is. Simple! Because if it had been different, we wouldn't be here!
- Imaginary numbers are, in a sense, numbers at right angles to ordinary real numbers. 
- "So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither a beginning nor end; it would simply be. What place then, for a creator?"

## 9. The Arrow of Time
- Just like the Special Theory of Relativity created a world with no absolute time, when one tries to combine General relativity and quantum mechanics, one must also rid of "real" time and add imaginary time. Imaginary time is indistinguishable from directions in space. If one can go forward in imaginary time, one also ought to be able to go backward.
	- But this doesn't happen in real time. There's obviously a big difference between the past and the future. Where does this difference come from? Why does one remember the past but not the future?
- The increase of disorder with time is one example of what is called the arrow of timeâ€“something that distinguishes the past from the future. There are the directions of the arrow of time:
	- First, the thermodynamic arrow, is the direction of time in which disorder or entropy increases.
	- Second, is the psychological arrow. This is the direction in which we feel time pass; the direction in which we remember the past but not the future.
	- Third, is the cosmological arrow of time. This is the direction of time in which the universe is expanding rather than contracting.
		- How do each of these point in the same direction? That's what this chapter is about.
- First, thermodynamic:
	- Entropy arises from the fact that there are always many more disordered states than there are ordered ones.

## Quotes
- The whole history of the science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in any arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a certain underlying order, which may or may not be divinely inspired.
- It seems clear that there are relatively few ranges of values for the numbers [in the universe] that would allow the development of any form of intelligent life.

## Random Tidbits

## Questions
- It's often stated that time wasn't created before the universe, which makes sense in theory but not in practice. To me at least. Time isn't something we created, it's just something we started to measure at some point. Isn't it?   kkkGravity existed before we discovered it. Gravity also likely existed before the universe. If the universe did get started by the big bang, something had to attract the particles and gases tightly enough to cause the first explosion. Also if this happened, the big bang was at a certain point in time. For if there was no time, there would be no way to say the Big Bang happened X. 
- If the light from the beginning of the universe is just now reaching us, and it's stretched and red-shifted, then how did we get here? If everything started in one bang, and nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and the light is just now reaching us, how did the explosion spread to get *us* here? (Chapter 3)
- If the universe is expanding, *what is the universe expanding into?* If you have a balloon in a small box and fill it up from an air hose connected outside the box, you can only inflate that balloon so big until it reaches the edges of the box and the force from against the box battling the air filing up the balloon eventually wins and the balloon explodes. 
- If the event horizon of a black hole is marked by the light rays that can't escape the gravitational pull of the black hole, doesn't that suggest that the force of gravity, at a certain mass, is faster than the speed of light?
	- Upon further thought and reading, maybe not. Because the light from the event horizon never gets captured by the gravitational attraction - if it did we wouldn't see it. It's *just* quick enough to escape the pull, but not *quite* fast enough to completely get away from it. So light is faster than the gravitational attraction, but not my much.
- If gravity is a warping of space-time based on an objects matter, and an object gets destroyed, what happens to the gravitational field? The law of the conservation of matter states you can't destroy or create matter, only change it. But if earth were thrown into a million pieces, surely it would no longer have the gravitational pull on the moon. Where did that gravity go? Did it just get divided up into a million pieces? And what about something like firewood. If you burn firewood, the wood turns to ash and smokeâ€“where does the gravity go?
