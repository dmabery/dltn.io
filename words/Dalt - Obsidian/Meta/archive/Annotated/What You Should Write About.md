Great writing comes from those explorations, from building new castles with your set of bricks, and from making an honest effort to figure things out. The trap writers can fall into is from being afraid to push those boundaries, and building the same structures over and over because mom and dad keep telling them how smart and talented they are.

The best writing isn't for anyone else. It's for you. It's to try to clear the fog on the questions wracking your brain, regardless of who wants to join for the ride. **For writing to resonate with others, it needs to resonate with you first. And the scarier the fog you're willing to share your journey through, the more people it will resonate with.**

People will read to learn, but we want to be seen more than anything. To know we're not the only ones with these frightening questions fogging up our brains. To know we're not crazy, not alone, and we have at least one friend in the fog with a lantern.

The pressure of trying to be useful to others forces you to explore and distill your knowledge in a highly efficient way. Without that pressure, it would be easy to spend days or weeks researching a topic without doing any synthesis of what you're exploring. And without synthesis, it's hard to say you really learned anything.
