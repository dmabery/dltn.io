- The pandemic was a reset button on people's routines. Like how when a computer freezes and you realize you have all of this crap running in the background and have to do a hard reboot to stop it - that's what the pandemic did to people's lives. This was helpful for some people, but also not helpful for others. 
- You have to design your life to be condusive to what you're trying to do. #quotes
- What's so depressing about a lot of people's lives, is that they have no connection to their [[impulse voices]] - the voices inside of them that say, "I'm drawn to this. This is what I want to do."
- "Fame is the excrement of creativity" #quotes #BruceDickinson
	- People are obsessed with the outcome and don't focus enough on the craft. 

	*This is what I want to work on this year. Being so devoted to the craft of writing, reading, and developing that I forget about the outcomes at all. This is 100% the cause of my sadness and angst towards other people lately - focusing on likes and followers and not just sticking my head in the ground and working on the craft.*
- Too many people want to have authored a book, but no one wants to actually write the book. If you can fall in love with the process of writing, a book will eventually come.

Too many people want to have a succesful company, no one wants to have the idea for a successfull company or put in the work for one.
- The sense of building something from nothing is the highest quality a human can have.
	- This is the reason I want to start a company, write, build something - not sell courses or videos or whatever. Sure it's still building and props to the people who have made six figures with that, I haven't done that. But not how I want to do that.
- Genius: Being able to see something in a different angle than most people. #quotes #genius
- You don't get good stuff choosing the easy way. #quotes
