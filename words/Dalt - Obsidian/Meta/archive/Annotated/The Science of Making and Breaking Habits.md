Limbic Friction #vocab - the strain that's required to overcome one of two states in your body:
	- anxiousness (too alert)
	- Too tired or lazy (too calm)
	- Autonomic nervousystem - system that regulates those two states
	- how much activation energy needed to participate in a behavior. 
	- Sort of like motivation, but this a legit brain process while motivation is a very abstract concept.

Linchpin Habits - Habits that make it easier to form other habits. #JamesClear calls these #KeyStoneHabits. These are always habits you enjoy, enjoy doing.

Goal for this episode is to identify which habits are easy. which habits are hard, and which habits you want to break.

My linchpin habits:
	- Reading
	- Waking up early
	- Working out (on routine)

#### Habit strength: (two aspects)
1. How context dependent a habit is.
			Reading for me is a context dependent habit.
			Drinking coffee is context indepent for me.
2. How much limbic friction is required to perform that habit on a regular basis.

The stronger the habit strength, the more engrained the habits are within you and the more automatic the habits will become. Most books out there explain how to get from high limbic friction to automaticity.

#### Procedural Memory Visualization 30 minutes in

There are two types of memory:
	• Episodic Memory
			This is where you rememeber scenes and pictures in your head about what happened.
	 • Procedural Memory
			- This is where you rememeber the steps or "recipe" you need to take to make something happen. Like excerise sets, you remember the steps you need to take.
			- This is one technique you can use to build better habits. By thinking through each step of the habit process, it helps get the habit in memory.
				- What are the mental steps required to perform this habit from start to finish?
#HebbianLearning - when neurons fire together they tend to strengthen their connection with eachother - NMDA Receptors on the neuron surface that are acitvated when they get a strong input that triggers to the surface of the neuron more receptors that allows the neuron to trigger in the future with less input. In other words, it makes a neuron that's unlikely to fire, more likely to fire.

Thinking through the steps (procedural memory), it sets in motion the same neurons that are going to be required for execution of that habit when you actually do perform the action - making the dominoes less likely to fall and easier to perform the habit.  #contentideas
