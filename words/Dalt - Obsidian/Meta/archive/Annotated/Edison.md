# Edison

# Part 1 Botany
- Abstract thought did not come easily to Edison. While he was trying to think through [[Einstein]]'s theory of relativity, he said: "My line of sorrow lies in the realm of technical science" p.15
- He "Monomaniacally focused on whatever project interested him, he strode at a forward angle, hands in vest pockets, aware only of the destination and completely unconscious of time."
- His son, Charles Edison, wrote poetry under the name "Tom Sleeper" p.19
- Similar to [[Einstein]], he didn't like authority and didn't appreciate anyone telling him how to think or what to do
- Edison, while trying to hire a bunch of people for his factory after firing a bunch, devised a questionnaire of general facts to see how many were deemed worth hiring. 4% of the initial batch passed.
	- *"Men who have gone to college I find to be amazingly ignorant"*
	- A lot of people thought the quiz to be dumb. Including [[Einstein]]. He saw, "no point in cluttering his mind with facts available in an encyclopedia" p.31. Einstein said, "Edison attached too great a value to memory."
	- [[Edison devised the test to see who was the most curious]]
- Edison, in his old age, had almost gone completely deaf. People became frustrated with the difficulty to communicate with him, but he didn't mind. *"In fact I consider it an advantage as it has preserved me from the distractions of a noisy world."*
- When he went to visit his hometown, Morris writes, "He led the way to the little northeast bedroom, feeling whatever a man feels when he contemplates the first walls he ever saw" [[Writing Bits I Love]]
	- I like how he didn't try to explain the feeling and give an adjective to it. He let the reader be put in that position and let them stir up the feelings they might have themselves.
- *"Until a man duplicates a blade of grass, nature can laugh at his so-called scientific knowledge."*
