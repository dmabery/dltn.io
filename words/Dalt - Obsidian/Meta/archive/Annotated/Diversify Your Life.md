Diversification is resilience in action. It's having something in reserve. It's knowing that everyone, everywhere, doing anything, will eventually suffer setbacks, frustration, and despair. And planning for that by packing a bag with more than just hammers

It's fine to lean on one pillar or another at different times in your life, but you'd do well to make sure there's a few others holding up the roof if the first one crumbles. Yes, rock it out at work, but reserve some evenings and weekends for a hobby too. Sure, enjoy that tight-knit crew, but realize that life eventually changes for them some day as well.
