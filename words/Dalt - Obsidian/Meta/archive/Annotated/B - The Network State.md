# B - The Network State

## Summary

## Notes
- A network state is an online community that is capable of collaboration and raises money to buy territory around the world. Eventually gaining diplomatic recognition from existing territories.
	- Or:
		> A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.
