## Notes
- When institutions and ideas are new, there's a great moment of plasticity to form what they truly become and how the interact with the daily lives of people. As the creation date gets further and further, changing ideas or institutions becomes harder and harder. MacAskill gives the illustration of molten glass being shaped; when molten glass first comes out of the oven, it can be shaped and molded but as it cools it becomes more rigid. If you try to shape it after its cooled, it breaks.
- The signifigance of changing values in a society is very great. MacAskill argues that instead of lobbying for a specific policy or plan, lobby instead for the people to embrace a particular value. This will ensure that the value continues to work effectively in the future and isn't handcuffed by the policy that was put in place many years in the past. Who knows if that policy would even work very well?
