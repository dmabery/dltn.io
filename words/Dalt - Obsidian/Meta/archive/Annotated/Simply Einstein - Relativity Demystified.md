# Simply Einstein - Relativity Demystified
 # The Self Creating Universe and Other Absurdities
- [[Gott's Time Loop]]
- [[You can timetravel by leapfrogging into the future]]
- [[Simple Relativity]], in its barest essence, is that the laws of physics are exactly the same, regardless of one's state of motion.
	- The laws of physics are the same for all, that's the [[Principle of Relativity]].

# Moving Heaven and Earth
- Motion involves passing through time and space
- When [[Venus]] is fully lit by the sun, it appears the smallest. When it's lit like a crescent, it appears the biggest. [[Gallileo]] first discovered this with his telescope, and it helped him reason that the Earth is not the center of the galaxy. If it were, Venus wouldn't be changing sizes so much, but it does because when it's a crescent, it's closest to the earth on its orbit and when it's full, it's furthest from the earth - making it smaller.
- One of the biggest examples of [[The old order always rejects the new]] is that of [[Gallileo]], the man was imprisoned for creating a new theory and wasn't exonerated until 1992!

# Let There Be Light
- Up to this point, we have an understanding of relativity - the laws of physics are the same for all, and we were introduced to the idea of gravity and motion in the last chapter. Now, it's time for light.
- [[Newton]] believed that light was particles. Sound, it was already assumed, was waves and sound travels relative to someone. Sound travels at 700 miles per hour, so a boat traveling away from a dock at 50mph will hear someone shouting from the dock at 650mph (700 - 50). This is because light travels at 700mph relative to the air. If you're moving through the air, it will affect the speed of sound. But did light function the same way?
	- Newton thought light was particles. He gave an explanation of color by positing that different particles excite different vibrations, which result in color.
	- But Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch Scientist, proposed that light, like sound, was waves. A color wave theory could be that different frequencies of the wave resulted in different colors, just like different frequencies of sound resulted in different pitches. Since Huygens was some rando, most people went with Newton's theory.
- An experiment in 1801 by [[Thomas Young]] proved that light, was in fact, waves. So we know light, like sound, are waves. But that begs the question: **waves of what?**
- [[Newton]] had an idea called "action at a distance", which explained that objects can act on others at a distance instantaneously. So if the earth disappeared, the moon would instantly begin to travel in a straight line, as it's supposed to.
	- [[The moon is falling towards earth and moving in a straight line]]
	- But as we came to learn, through the introductions of fields, that's not exactly what was happening. Instead, the Earth had a gravitational field and any objects in that field followed that force. So the moon isn't acting based on what it knows about earth at a distance, it's simply following the local conditions of its field. *Note: This explanation and the action at a distance explanation currently have the same outcome, it's just a different way of explaining that outcome.*
	- The field explanation allows us to assume that it acts independent of the earth. Though it is caused by the earth, if the earth vanished, would the field still exist for a certain period of time?
- The field example of gravity works in the same way that electric fields do, and this discovery has just been made p.47. **Now we know that a moving magnetic field creates an electric field.** 
	- So electric fields have two possible sources:
		- An electric charge
		- A changing magnetic field
			- *Note: The second one has a direct relationship with each other. A change in one will produce a change in the other.*
	- **Moving electric charge creates a magnetic field**
	- **A changing magnetic field creates an electric field**
	- [[John Maxwell]] thought a changing electric field would create a magnetic field. So he experimented and created equations, which proved to be right. His modified set of four statements provides a complete picture of all electromagnetic phenomena. These became [[Maxwell's Equations]].

	### So what's the big deal?
	- Maxwell soon came to realize that the ability for a changing magnetic field to create an electric field and a changing electric field would create a magnetic field was a continuous cycle, rippling out from its source, called a [[Electromagnetic wave]].
	- If you take an electrically charged object and move it back and forth, it creates a magnetic field. Since the electrical field is changing, the magnetic field is changing. What does a changing magnetic field create? An electric field. But since the magnetic field is changing, so is the electric field, which creates a magnetic field and on and on.
		- Once this process gets started, the fields are all independently existing, irregardless of the first emitting source.
			- [[Your habits ripple out like a magnetic field]]
		- The fields don't just sit there either, they propagate through space as an electromagnetic wave, just like the field of gravity worked in the earlier example.
	- His equations also determined the speed of these waves, and they were equal to that of light. So, he concluded that light must be an electromagnetic wave! (Or a wave containing electricity and magnetism)
		- The speed of light is the speed of light in a vacuum. When light travels through matter, the electricity interacts with the matter and it slows down. [[Refraction]] is the process of contact lens or plastic slowing down the light while it's in the lens.
		- 186,000 mph #speedOfLight
	- The frequency of the wave is the frequency of the moving motion of the magnet or electric field, which would also determine its wavelength. Different type of lightwaves are really the same thing, it's just their frequency and wavelength that differ. The nicknames we gave just make it easier to understand.

	### A Brief History of Physics
	- This is where we were in the late 1800s. We had Netwon's laws that govern mechanics and laws of motion and Maxwell's equations that governed electromagnetism.
		- 1600 - 1750 was all about motion
		- 1750 - 1900 was all about electromagnetism
	- But did these really cover everything? Newton had a relativity principle, that said his laws work the same in all reference frames, but does Maxwell's equations have the same? **This is where Einstein started.***

# Ether Dreams
- We know the speed of light, but that speed of light is *c* relative to what? WIth sound, we know the speed of sound is relative to the air, because that's the medium it disrupts to travel on. So what's the air, to light?
- They believed it to be the ether. Since you can't talk where there is no air, but we get light from all over the galaxy, then we assumed ether is everywhere.
- Note: [[Sound travels faster in water than air because water is more stiff]]
- The question, Does Maxwell's equations work the same in all reference frames has an interesting answer: No, it doesn't. They only work in one reference frame, because his equations have the speed of light as *c*, which would assume the observer is at rest with respect to the ether.
	- But, observers moving through the ether, not at rest, would measure the speed of light different from *c*, therefore his equations couldn't quite possibly work for someone in a moving reference from relative to the ether.
	- But how does one branch of physics, Newton's laws, have a relativity principle but another branch, electromagnetism, not? That can't be right...p.60
- **The speed of light is independent of its source**. Like sound, light won't travel faster when emitted from a moving object because it's still traveling relative to whatever its disrupting.
- Contradiction that I believe Einstein was facing until he looked at time on page 62.

	### Earth and The Ether
	- If we assume ether is the medium in which light waves propagate, the question is asked, how is earth moving relative to the ether? If we were moving 90% of the speed of light, light from stars moving towards earth would get here at 2x the speed of light (almost) and light from stars moving away from earth would reach us in 1/10 of a time. But if the earth were moving much slower through the ether, we might not notice any difference.
		- So, how fast and in what direction is earth moving through the ether? Put more simply, is earth moving relative to the ether?
			- We know the earth is moving relative to the ether, so the question becomes how fast and in what direction? This is what 19th century physics set out to answer.

	### Wrap up: Physics in 1880
	- Together, Newton's mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetism seem to explain all known physical phenomena. But, there's a dichotomy between how Newton has a relativity principle that electromagnetism doesn't seem to have.
	- Light is an electromagnetic wave traveling at speed *c* through the ether. The speed of light does not depend on the motion of the source and the earth must be in motion relative to the ether.
	- The only thing missing to solidify the ether theory is to measure earth's motion through the ether - which has been tried but not proven yet.

# Crisis in Physics
- [[Michelson-Morlay experiment]] should have shown the speed at which earth traveled through the [[ether]], but every attempt at doing so, didn't prove it was. The earth must be moving, we knew that. We just didn't know the speed at which it was moving relative to something else.
- This was a crisis because it meant they were wrong about one of the main branches of physics at the time, electromagnetism.

# Einstein to the Rescue
- His [[special theory of relativity]] was essentially a generalization of [[Gallileo]]'s relativity principle. In one sentence, The Special Theory of Relativity can be explained:

	> The laws of physics are the same in all uniformly moving reference frames.

	- In other words, there is no preferred state of motion for describing physical reality. That if two people are both moving uniformly, will discover the exact same underlying physical laws–even though they may be moving relative to each other.
- But the troubelsome part of this theory is that it says there is no variant to the speed of light (speed *c*), because it makes sense that there would be for two people moving relative to one another, but it's not. Speed *c* is invariant...
	- You can understand it's invariant by first accepting the Principle of Relativity, that says, again, **the laws of physics are the same in all uniform states of motion**. From there...
		- First, understand the laws of electromagnetism predict electromagnetic waves going at speed *c*
		- Second, the laws of physics are valid in all reference frames, thus, the conclusion that electromagnetic waves moving at speed *c* must be valid in all reference frames.
			- It's from this invariance of *c* follow the many counterintuitive results of special relativity.

# Stretching Time
- Space and time are not absolute, they change depending on the reference frame.Measures of spacial distances and time intervals are simply different in different reference frames.
	- In Figure 8.1, the spaceship might be moving relative to you, but because its measurements of space and time are different form yours, you come up with the same value.
- Time being different conflicts with our basic common sense understanding of time. But our experiences of time are not wide enough to prove with absolute doubt that time clicks universally. The fastest we've moved relative to anything special is in a jet around 600mph. So there are differences, just too small for us to notice.
	### Time Dilation
	- Every event has a place and a time. Events are separated by their event location and by the event time. **The time interval between two events cannot be the same for two observers in motion relative to each other.**
	- Figure 8.3 (p.100) shows the light box "experiment." 8.3a shows a light beam going to the mirror and coming back. You can measure how long this took with math. Figure 8.3b shows the same event happening, but with the box moving. But since the light now travels in a diagonal, relative to your reference frame as an observer, it's natural to conclude that the time between events A & B were longer than in 8.3a because light had to travel a longer distance. But the speed of light can't change, it's invariant (Principle of Relativity), so time must have slown while the box was in motion.
		- We're not saying the light took two different trips. Rather, they took the same trip and we're looking at it from a different frame of reference.
	- [[*Time Dilation*]] - The time between two events **is shortest** when measured in a reference from where the two events occur at the same place.
		- Formula on page 106.

# Star Trips and Squeezed Space
- An object is longer in a frame of reference where the object is at rest and shorter in. a frame of reference where the object is moving.
- [[Muon and Time Dilation experiment]]
	- Also, Mt. Washington gets contracted by the same factor that time dilation does, 1/9. So Mt. Washington becomes 700 feet high.
