# Writer's Retreat

- p.40 has some interesting words about writer's and their different habits. It's interesting that almost all of them have some sort of daily word goal - though some more strict than others
- German poet, [[Friedrich Schiller]] kept a drawer full of rotten apples in his desk. He claimed the chemical effects of which induced a light-headed feeling he found to be essential to creation.
- "I walk about and look at people, out with their children, and I think, do they realise how fragile it all is?"
- [[Ray Bradbury]], when writing *Fahrenheit 451*, he worked in 30-minute sprints. The library at UCLA had typewriters for rent for a dime every 30 minutes. In between dime drops, he would wander the library and look for quotes and other inspiration. Then he would race back and write for another 30 minutes. Within nine days, he finished a 25,000 word first draft. He finished the rest in just 9 more days.
- **Writer's use their solitude to invent company.**
- Read about the creative getaways for writer's and other artists today. A lot of writers went to hotels and naturally wrote there, but some went to Yaddo and MacDowell, quiet escapes from the noise of reality. It would be cool to write about these. 
- "You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have." #quotes [[Maya Angelou]]
- Poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] wanted to live the life of a poet. So, he wrote a report explaining how his job could be replaced by an IBM mechanical brain and he was fired. Free to live the life of a poet #illustrations #tweet 
- "I write for myself, for my own pleasure. And I want to be left alone to do it." [[J.D. Salinger]]
- [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote in a shack in his garden. He called the shack "London", so when visitors dropped by, they could be told he was working in the capital. This did well to keep the visitors away. #illustrations He continued writing in this shed until he died at 94 years old. #tweet 
- [[Virginia Woolf]] wrote early in the morning, with a regularity of a stockbroker said her husband, even on weekends. It stopped promptly at one o'clock.
- [[Roald Dahl]]'s [[more on writing routines | writing routine]] is on page 105. #creativeroutines 
	- In his writing hut, he had a Christmas Card hanging up from a postman named [[Willy Wonka]].
	- He also had a shotput sized ball made of chocolate bar wrappers.
- "What one writer can make in the solitude of one room is something no power can easily destroy." [[Salman Rushdie]]
