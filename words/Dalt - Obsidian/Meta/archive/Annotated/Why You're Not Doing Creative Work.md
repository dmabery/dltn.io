- In creative work, there are two phases. Exploration and execution:

## Exploration
Don't really know what the idea is going to be, not really sure what you're going to do with the idea, but it's there.

Non-linear relationship between time and work output. Not sure whatever it is your thinking about or ideating on will even be good! Other stuff might steal you from working on it.

## Execution
In the execution phase, you are inspired. You know what the thing is and you know how to make it. All you have to do is sit down and do the damn thing.

In this phase, time moves fast. You think about the project all of the time and it's easy to work on it.

Linear relationship between time and output. The more time you put in, usually, the more output you'll get. 
***
These aren't linear - you go back and forth between the two. 

What most people mean when they say they don't have enough time to do creative work is that they don't have enough exploration time. Or [[The exploration time is used ineffectively and they lost everything they were exploring]]

It's easy to do the execution phase of the work because our brain knows the inherent, good rewards at the end of the rainbow. It also knows the negative consequences if the work isn't done. So it gets it done.

### How to make exploration more valuable to your brain
- Just because it doesn't seem productive, doesn't mean it isn't. The exploration phase is a lot of reading, studying, and thinking - not actual "working." But these steps are crucial to a great piece of finished work.
- Use it as an escape - I do this pretty well

>**Take the long view.** Another way to reduce the reward value assigned to other tasks is to attend to how important they will actually be in 10 years. Many things that feel like emergencies today are, in fact, going to be irrelevant to you as time goes on. If you can take the long view on your outside tasks, you might have an easier time attending to your creative work.
- I feel the above quote a lot and enjoy it. I know that 10 years from now, I'm going to enjoy the fact that I can explain relativity. 

enjoyed your latest! the tension between exploring and executing is another reason note-taking systems are so important. if you're constantly exploring, but throwing those notes and ideas in random places, it's going to be that much harder to execute.
