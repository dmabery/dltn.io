# Are crowds smarter or dumber than individual people?

IN *Noise*, they explain the two phrases "madness of the crowd" and "wisdom of the crowd" and try to understand which is right â€“ are crowds crazy or are they insane?

If individuals of the crowd make their own judgements in private and then are asked for the information, they are indeed more likely to be wise. But if it is a crowd who has come together based on some ideas or something, the information gleaned from them most likely won't be wise.

The idea is that in a crowd, each person's answer collectively average out anyone who is not thinking right, but you don't get that effect if the crowd already thinks the same thing.
