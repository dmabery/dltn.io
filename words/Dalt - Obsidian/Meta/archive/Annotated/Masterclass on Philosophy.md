#### How to Think Like a Philosopher
- The first step of purising philosophy is to be a non-conformist long enough to that you can question certain assumptions and presuppositions. 
- When you let presuppositions go, it's a form of death. There is no life without death. Philosophy is learning how to die.
- #Socrates had an intellectual revolution when he asked poets, mathemeticans, and politicians questions and realized they had no idea what they were talking about. Since Socrates *knew* he didn't know anything, he deemed himself to be the smartest and that became his presupposition.
