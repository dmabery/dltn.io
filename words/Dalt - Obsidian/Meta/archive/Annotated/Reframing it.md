Yes, the total is the same, but one involves loss while the other involves missed expectations. I find it a lot easier to deal with underestimating total cost than feeling like I got screwed. Construction projects frequently go over budget. People deal with this all the time. The community is large! You're a member now.  
  
Loss aversion is of course how it's described, but applying technical definitions doesn't often change how you feel. Being able to reframe it does.
