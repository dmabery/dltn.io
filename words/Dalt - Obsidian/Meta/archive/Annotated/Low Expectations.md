Purposely low expectations is the only way to survive in a world that’s not kind enough to reward every ambitious person with success.

*The only way to avoid disappointment is to expect it. Not in a pessimistic, Eor way. But in a realistic way. If you're trying to do something that has never been done before, the odds of it working on the first or second try is slim to none. But that's okay because you learn. But if you're too busy being disappointed about the first failure, you'll never work up enough courage to try it, or anything else, ever again. 
[[The only way to avoid disappointment is to expect it.]]*

When people say, “higher risk equals higher return” they should actually be saying, “higher risk means I’ll probably earn lower returns most of the time but there’s a small chance I’ll earn very good returns that make up for it.”

All luxuries become necessities in due time. It’s why “everything’s amazing and no one’s happy,” as Louis C.K. says.

Low expectations don’t make you depressed – they do the opposite, making little gains feel amazing while bad news feels normal.

But imagine the tragedy of unbelievable progress throughout your life and enjoying none of it because you expected all of it.

My friend Brent has a theory about marriage: It only works when both people want to help their spouse while expecting nothing in return. If you both do that, you’re both pleasantly surprised. #marriageAdvice
