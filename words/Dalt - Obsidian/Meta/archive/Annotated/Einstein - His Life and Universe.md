[[The Life That Bridged the Questions of The Universe With Simple Explanations]]

## Insights From the Book

### The goal of science is to discover why the universe acts the way that it does.
- "There was a harmonious reality underlying the laws of the universe, and the goal of science was to discover it."

- What science teaches us, is the correlation between factual evidence and general theories, something well illustrated in Einstein's life.

### Einstein's success was rooted in his ability to question the mundane things in life and not respect authority
- Einstein's success at life came from marveling at the mysteries that struck others as mundane, questioning conventional wisdom, and challenging authority.
- Throughout his life, Einstein never lost his sense of wonder at the magic of nature's phenomena. He retained the ability to hold two thoughts in his mind simultaneously, to be puzzled when they conflicted, and to marvel when he could smell and underlying unity. "People like you and me never grow old," he wrote an old friend, "We never cease to stand like curious children before the great mystery into which we were born."
- Einstein's scientific success had come in part from his rebelliousness. There was a link between his creativity and his willingness to defy authority. He had no sentimental attachment to the old order, thus was energized by upending it. His stubbornness had worked to his advantage.

### Einstein was a purely theoretical physicist. He never ran experiments himself.
- One of the interesting things about Einstein is that he never ran experiments. He was purely theoretical. In his papers, he would end them by explaining a few ways someone who wanted to test it, could, and if they did, they should get in touch with him.
	- I love this because it shows that you don't have to solve a problem to be a critical thinker. Merely thinking about the problem is something that can go along way
	
### Einstein didn't let anything get in the way of his science
- Einstein was a true loner and didn't really want to let much get in the way of his scientific endeavors. He is quoted while trying to divorce Marić to marry Elsa saying, "For I shall never give up the state of living alone, which has manifested itself as an indescribable blessing."

### Einstein had a beef with quantum theory
- After his theories of relativity had made their way, he explored the world of quantum mechanics and basically spent the rest of life trying to create a unified field theory. His beef with quantum mechanics was that things seemed to appear to work chaotically at a subatomic level. There was no way to predict how particles are interacting with each other, outside of observing it. But once you observe it, that influences the particles and you're not seeing it for what it truly is. 
		- Einstein thought this preposterous. He couldn't come to believe that the good Lord would have created beautiful and subtle rules that have determined *most* of what happened in the universe, while leaving a few things completely to chance. 
			- This attitude was in direct contrast to his belief as a younger scientist. He thought there was nothing that could be known unless it was observed, which led him to relativity. But now he's saying that there must be rules that govern the universe, no matter one's ability to observe it. In a way, his dive into quantum mechanics was the start of him becoming the old order and a new wave of scientists saying, "We don't know that." 
			- Einstein, as he got older, couldn't help but believe that there was some higher spirit - an organizer or creator of all the rules in the universe. No way he thought all of this just happened. There's too much simplicity for things to just happen the way that they did.
	- Einstein believed that all scientific theories, leaving aside their mathematical expressions, ought to lend themselves to so simple a description "that even a child could understand them."
	- *Esse est percipi* - To be is to be perceived. From [[George Berkley]]
	- **Einstein's belief in God changed**, but never his attitude towards organized religion:
		- "I'm not an atheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. We are in a position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must've written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. They child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books and doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see the universe marvelously arranged and obeying certain laws but only dimly understand these laws."
		- "The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle. To sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is something that our minds cannot grasp, whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only indirectly: this is religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I am a devoutly religious man."
		- "My religiosity consists of a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we can comprehend about the knowable world. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God."
		- "Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe–a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way, the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naïve." p.388
		- *The main argument between science and religion, as Einstein states, is not whether or not there is a God. It's that scientist's job is to study the laws and rules of the universe and they can't comprehend that those would change based on the interaction of a diety. Divine will, or human free will, does not play a role in the cosmic causality* p.391
		- Asked whether or not we have free will, he responed, "No. I am a determinist. Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control...– We all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible plater."
		- For some people, miracles are evidence that God exists. For Einstein it was the absence of miracles that reflected divine providence. The fact that the cosmos is comprehensible, that it follows laws, is worthy of awe.
	- [[Erwin Schrodinger]] and his cat hypothesis came as a way to help Einstein in his rebuttle toward quantum mechanics. As some believed the observation of a particle would interrupt the particles state, so its nucleus was both alive and dead until it was observed. This made sence at a quantum level, but when abstracted to a more real life scenario, it seemed crazy. This is where the cat came into play. p.453
	- The last thing he wrote, before he went to sleep for the last time, was one more line of symbols and numbers that he hoped might get him, and the rest of us, just a little step closer to the spirit manifest in the laws of the universe.
	- President Eisenhower on Eisntein:
		- "No other man contributed so much to the vast expansion of the 20th century knowledge. Yet no other man was more modest in the posession of the power that is knowledge, more sure tha power without wisdom is deadly."
	- The NYT on Einstein after his death:
		- "Man stands on this diminutive earth, gazes at the myriad of stars and upon billowing ocean and tossing trees–and wonders. What does it all mean? How did come about? The most thoughtful wonderer who appeared among us in three centuries has passed on in the person of Albert Einstein."
			- [[How I want to be remembered]] - "**The most thoughtful wonderer.**"
	- The explanation that Einstein himself most often gave for his mental Accomplishments was his curiosity. As he put it near the end of his life, "I have no special talents, I am only passionately curious."
	- Curiosity, in Einstein's case, came not just from a desire to question the mysterious. More important, it came from a childlike sense of marvel that propelled him to question the familiar, those concepts that, as he once said, "the ordinary adult never bothers his head about."
	- Freedom was the lifeblood of creativity. The most important aspect of his personality was his willingness to be a nonconformist.
	- The world has had a lot of geniuses. What made Einstein special was that his mind and soul were tempered by his humility - the belief that no one had the right to impose ideas and beliefs on others. 
	- Isaacson on Einstein, "He was a loner with an intimate bond to humanity, a rebel who was suffused with reverence. And thus it was that an imaginative, impertinent, patent clerk became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom and the universe."

#### How Einstein Came up with Ideas
From p. 350-351 
- Einstein began with postulates that he had abstracted his understanding of the physical world, such as the equivalence of gravity and acceleration. That was not something he could come up with by studying data. Einstein's greatest strength as a theorist was that he had a keener ability than other scientists to come up with what he called, "The general postulates and principles which serve as a starting point."
	- Then, he would create a general principle from nature and rely on a mix between physical intuition and mathematical formalism to march toward some testable conclusions.
- Essentially, he had an idea, formed postulates, then formed a theory of how those work, and then used mathematics to formulate and prove them.

## All About Relativity
- Relativity is a simple concept, the implications are what's difficult. It asserts that the fundamental laws of physics are the same whatever your state of motion.
	- Began for Einstein in 1905. It begins actually in 1632, with Galilean relativity. In his *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems*, Galileo wanted to defend Copernicus' idea that the earth did not lay motionless at the center of the universe. Opposers of this idea thought that if we did move, we would feel it. But he refuted that with a brilliant thought experiment, about the ship and the fish. 
- Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity was revolutionary because it expanded upon that principle of relativity, and he came to conclude that there is no absolute time. For time is different for observers depending on their relative reference frame.
- Began to generalize his special with three key assumptions, p.197
- Race to general relativity - 1915 p.211
- Black holes are the only place in the universe where the theory of relativity shows its full glory. Time and space warp into each other and time dillates almost to 0, so someone observing something moving by the black hole would appear as if it weren't moving at all.

## Timeline
- Quest began in 1895, at 16 years-old when he first thought about what it would be like to ride alongside a light beam.
- His fame really began after 1919, when the eclipse confirmed his prediction of how gravity would bend light. 
- After being mesmerized by a compass' needle, Einstein would develop a lifelong devotion to field theories as a way to describe nature. [[Field Theories]] use mathematical quantities, such as numbers or vectors or tensors, to describe how the conditions at any point in space will affect matter or another field. 
- Wrote his light quanta paper in 1905. p.94
- Started special relativity in 1905
- Began to think of general relativity in 1907.
	- It would take Einstein abother eight years, until November 1915 to work out the fundamentals of his theory and find the math to express it. Then it would take another four years before the most vivid of his predictions, the extent to which gravity would bend light, was verified, which would go on to launch his fame. 

## Quotes from Einstein #quotes 
- Near the end of his life, New York State Education Department asked Einstein what they should teach in school. He replied, "In teaching history, there should be an extensive discussion of personalities who benefited mankind through independence of character and judgement." p.6
	- Isaacson goes on to write, "Societies competitive advantage will come not from how well its schools teach multiplication tables, but from how well they stimulate imagination and creativity"
		- Einstein's life oozes that imagination and creativity, all rooted in his insatiable curiosity for how the world works and understanding the systems behind it.
- "Imagination is more important than knowledge."
- "It is important to foster individuality, for only the individual can produce the new ideas."
- "When a person can take pleasure in marching in step to a piece of music it is enough to make me despise him. He has been given his big brain only by mistake."
	- p. 21 - after soldiers would march down his street as a kid.
- "A foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth."
- "A new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way. But, intuition is nothing but the outcomes of earlier intellectual experience."
- Einstein believed there was, "a definite connection between the knowledge acquired at the patent office and the theoretical results."
- "How an intelligent man can subscribe to a party I find a complete mystery."
- "To dwell on things that depress or anger us does not help in overcoming them. One must knock them down alone."
- "The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think."
- "Nature hides her secret because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of ruse."
- "All knowledge of reality starts from experience and ends in it."
- "I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."
- "I have no special talents, I am only passionately curious."
- "Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality
"The monotony of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind."
"Nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas."
