- Do people want the journey, or the destination?
- [[You should be learning and writing continuously and discretely]]
- [[Short v. long form content]] [[Quick v. considered content]]

## Discrete v. Continuous learning
- **Discrete** - Specific blocks of time spent learning something. Reading a book, taking a long course, doing a deep dive on a topics wiki page.
	- For [[Evergreen]] content, effort spent creating and consuming has a very high reward.
	- The problem, though, is that some people may never finish because the leap is too big. For the creator, the content can easily be outdated and changes will need to be made constantly.
- **Continuous** - Instead of time spent in a discrete block, continuous learning is picking things up here and there as you go along the course of your life. 
	- For a creator, this becomes tweets, newsletters, and digital garden notes. The consumer consumes these pieces of content.
	- The problem with this type, is that there is often a lot of context and background information that people are missing and it's hard to get up to speed.

Similarly, sometimes we want to learn continuously, and other times we want just one big source of information. **The best forms of learning combine the two modes.**

 If you learned continuously, it's nice to recap all you've learned in a guide or handbook you wish you had when you started.

 If you learned in a discrete block, it's best to revisit what you learned in a parallel.

 **One could say, the type of content you create is inversely correlated to how you learned it.**

 Learning is simultaneously continuous and discrete.

 As a content creator, you should be creating both. As a learner, you should be consuming both.

 > Ultimately I think you should try to do both. Prototype by making continuous knowledge items, but be aware that most people will never see your work there. So periodically you need to do “treasure collection” - go back through your continuous streams, and pick out the most promising threads to turn into bigger, discrete pieces.
