- Diplomats get parking tickets - The higher the national corruption index for a delegation's home country, the more tickets those delegations accumulated in NYC before immunity in 2002.

## Sections for [[Book Review]]

### Intro

- The idea that Protestants should read the bible by themselves, for themselves, started a wake of global literacy in the West. In towns where Protestant churches were more than Catholic, literacy was much higher.
- This literacy changed people's brains and altered their "cognitive abilities in domains related to memory, visual processing, facial recognition, numerical exactness, and problem-solving."
- This change in our brains alters how we see the world, but that hasn't been accurately depicted in studies because most subjects are all WEIRD.
- The ideas in this book are:
	- Religious convictions can powerfully shape decision making.
	- Beliefs, practices, and social norms can shape our brains. You can't separate culture from psychology or biology because culture physically rewires our brains and therefore shapes how we think.
	- This change of brains can cause many second-order effects, depending on what the change is.
	- Literacy is the first example of how Westerners became psychologically unusual.

### Chapter 1 - WEIRD Psychology

- Non-WEIRD societies are much more likely to associate with their relational roles and responsibilities than WEIRD societies are. This is the *individualistic complex* vs. *kin-based attitudes*. So, did individualistic complex lead to to the creation of government and a more free society? Or did something else create an individualistic attitude and a free society is an effect of that outlook?
- WEIRD people are much more likely to follow arbitrary rules of the road than non-WEIRD societies. Non-WEIRD societies feel a sense of loyalty to a friend or kin and will lie or do something "against the grain" to protect that friend. This doesn't happen often in WEIRD societies.
- Did a psychology of [[impersonal prosociality]] arise first, followed by formal governing institutions?
- When thinking analytically or holistically, WEIRD societies are much more analytical. 54  - if a culture became more analytically thought-focused, how might *that* influence government, society and law. (Now I see what he is setting up haha)

### 2 - Making a Cultural Species 
- "We have evolved genetically to learn adaptively in ways that calibrate our minds and behavior to the environments we encounter." Our capacity for cultural learnings have evolved to figure out *who* to learn from, what to learn, and when to use cultural learnings over experience or intuition.
- Over time, as our brains evolved to better learn (and innovate) on our cultural learnings, [[cumulative cultural evolution]] took shape. That describes the process of generations learning from the past, refining, updating, and adding more information that they discovered recently, and making something from the past better. This is how we get complicated tools, practices, and languages. 68
- We are a cultural species and have evolved to learn information from the minds and behaviors of others. The things we learn reprogram our minds, preferences, and perceptions.
- Social norms are created through institutions by cultural evolution. Things link kin-based altruism, incest aversion, pair-bonding, interdependence, and tribal affiliation are all norms that have evolved because the groups that do these things, follow the norms, and punish those who don't, end up stronger and more competitive than others. It's a survival of the fittest thing going on.

### 3 - Clans, States, and Why You Can't Get Here from There
- [[Clans and groups ability to scale up is dependent on the social and psychological fit between what exists in the group and the new norm or belief]]
- Humans aren't innately social - they are only if their institution requires them to be social, whether directly through punishment or indirectly through more social people getting outsized rewards and then evolving. [[The Matsigenka people were not very social]].
- How did we go from kin-based clans to modern-states with government institutions? This is the question at the end of this chapter--->

## 4 - The God's are watching - Behave
- Do unconscious reminders of God influence people's willingness to comply with norms of impersonal fairness?
	- Yes, but only if they are religious. If they're not religious, God primes do not have any affect on them at all.
	- **[[If God primes influence behavior, what other cues are influencing social behavior?]]**
