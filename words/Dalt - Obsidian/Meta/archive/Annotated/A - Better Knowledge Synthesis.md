Basically a new (smarter) way of thinking about literature notes and knowledge management that isn't the slip-box, lol.

Here is a diagram and an example.

The process:

1. Begin with a set of question notes and papers
	1. Every paper or source is read with these questions in mind.
2. Create observation notes
	1. Observation notes have the potential to inform one or more questions that you started with.
	2. Each observation note is grounded in at least one quote or context from a source and then directly linked to a question note.
3. Develop synthesis
	1. What does the literature have to say about the questions of interest?
	2. Synthesis notes also get explicitly linked to relevant question note.
4. Compose and combine synthesis notes and questions of interest into arguments and theories. 
	1. If done well, this process will reveal even more questions. That's okay. Go back to the question phase.
