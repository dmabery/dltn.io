If you think you can’t accomplish your goals with what you’ve got now, you are probably just not thinking creatively enough. From Choose Boring Technology

In the past week, there have been two articles published by some of my favorite writers. Coincedentally, they shared a thesis: **just get started**.

Simon Sarris, author of *The Map is Mostly Water*, published an article called "Start With Creation." In it, he dubunks the myth of inspiration, touts the importance of embracing difficult projects, and encourages his readers to learn in public. The other author, Nat Eliason, had a similar message but expressed it in a different way–through the enchanted productivity routine. In a piece titled "The Perfect Work Routine", Eliason encourages his readers to stop searching for the perfect "daily ritual" and instead to just get started working, letting the routine or ritual reveal itself naturally.

## The Romanticism of the Perfect Plan
Perhaps the popularization of having the perfect plan emerged during the 1920s on the back of the Jazz Age, increased wealth, and a celebration of the end of the Great War. America started dreaming again. Dreaming of the day when white picket fences would cover the neighborhoods and each man, women, and child were free to pursue that which they wanted.

Eventually, this created a revolution of planning that still happens today. Students spend their entire senior year of high school answering the question, "So what's next?" Having any sort of hesitation to that answer is looked down upon: with one group encouraging the path to college and higher education while another espouses the benefits of getting a job right away. Those who plan to take a gap year are encouraged to do otherwise.

The neccessity for having a plan is destorying the desire to just go do.
