1. Make sure you show off how smart you are (as the host)
2. Instead of asking the guest pointed questions, respond to what they say in an open-ended way and see what they fill the space with.
3. Ask questions you already know the answer to.
4. Ask the same questions your guest is asked on every other podcast they've been on.
5. Leave in all of the false starts. The host asks a question, the guest immediately starts talking, usually something like, "Let's see here..." or, "That's a great question..I...I...think...that...uhm...", or "Well...", and then starts the actual good answer.
