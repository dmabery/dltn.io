## How I pay my bills
I currrently work full-time as a video editor and designer for Farnam Street. My main tasks involve managing our podcast YouTube channel and turning our articles into videos (example here and here).

## Free time
Outside of work, I explore various disciplines to help me paint a better picture of how the world works. I'm currently studying history, science, and programming.

I read for an hour/day (book notes), write for about 30 minutes/day (posts), and write code for an hour/day (GitHub).

## What I'm hoping for
I want my next job to be as a programmer. I love writing code. It's challenging and fun. In the meantime, I'm working on building my skills in React and making difficult projects.

I was stuck in a state of limbo for awhileâ€“confused as to how to move forward. I thought going back to school for a CS degree was the right path, but I don't think it is. Instead, I'd like to get a job first as a programmer to make more connections, potentially have a mentor, and then from there figure out if going back to school is worth it.

If you or anyone you know needs help writing React code, let me know.
