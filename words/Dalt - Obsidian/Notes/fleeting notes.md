Fleeting Notes are notes, thoughts, ideas, questions, reflections, or anything else that you capture in the spur of the moment because you want to revisit it later. A lot of times they form a spark of inspiration in your mind, but you're not at a place to dive deep into the subject in the moment. So you write something quick to remind yourself about it later.

Fleeting notes, by themselves, aren't helpful. They're merely a breadcrumb to an idea much, much bigger than the loaf itself.

Fleeting notes should be the start of [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]], but [[Most people use notes as a burial ground]].
