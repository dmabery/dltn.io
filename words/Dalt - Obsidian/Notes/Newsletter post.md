If you've been a subscriber to this newsletter for a while, you know the template has changed...a lot. If that's you, thanks for sticking around. It really means a lot.

It's hard to find a unique, interesting, and sustainable format to send out every week. Since I started this in 2020, I still haven't found one that "works." But that's fine because I've enjoyed experimenting.

Here's a new format: 3 things I learned this week.

Let me know what you think. I'm sticking with this until July and will then reevaluate.

Also, I gave up on names for this newsletter, so now I'm just calling it _a newsletter_.

If you want to give up now and forget all about me, unsubscribe [​here​]({{ unsubscribe_url }}).

### John Steinbeck's anti-advice for writers

"If there is a magic in story writing, and I am convinced there is, no one has ever been able to reduce it to a recipe that can be passed from one person to another. The formula seems to lie solely in the aching urge of the writer to convey something he feels important to the reader. If the writer has that urge, he may sometimes, but by no means always, find the way to do it. You must perceive the excellence that makes a good story good or the errors that make a bad story. For a bad story is only an ineffective story.”

### Knock them when they're down

"Let's get away from this dreadful place," Grant said. "I suppose this work is part of the devil that is left in us all."

That comment came after witnessing the aftermath of a long day of fighting between soldiers. What came next shows us exactly the type of man that U.S. Grant was. Ulysses S. Grant, on his way back to headquarters, rode through an ugly battlefield of frozen corpses and endless carnage. Lying on the ground, he noticed a Union lieutenant next to a Confederate private, both wounded. Grant dismounted his horse, gave both gentlemen a swig of brandy, and demanded stretchers be brought to carry them away.

But when the stretcher bearers ignored the Confederate soldier, Grant was irate. "Take this Confederate, too. Take them both together; the war is over between them." Riding away, he quoted Robert Burns: "Man's inhumanity to man / makes countless thousands mourn."

This simple demonstration reveals much about Grant and his attitude toward war. He saw it for what it was: people fighting over ideas. It was nothing personal. Grant carried that attitude throughout every victory, usually giving the surrendering Rebels generous terms and never boasting about a victory.

Here's the insight: How someone treats those who matter little to them – especially when that person is vulnerable – is a great measure of character. Do they kick them when they're down? Or provide a helping hand?

### Getting "the last scrap" out of yourself

Winston Churchill smoked 10 cigars a day and was hardly without a drink. He didn't have a morning routine or a cold plunge habit. His secret for getting "the last scrap" out of his body? Naps.

From his Memoirs of the Second World War:

For this purpose [to stay in-step with the younger lads in the government] I had recourse to a method of life which had been forced upon me at the Admiralty in 1914 and 1915, and which I found greatly extended my daily capacity for work. I always went to bed at least for one hour as early as possible in the afternoon and exploited to the full my happy gift of falling almost immediately into deep sleep. By this means I was able to press a day and a half's work into one. Nature had not intended mankind to work from eight in the morning until midnight without that refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts twenty minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces. I regretted having to send myself to bed like a child every afternoon, but I was rewarded by being able to work through the night until two or even later – sometimes much later – in the morning, and begin the new day between eight and nine o'clock. This routine I observed throughout the war, and **I commend it to others if and when they find it necessary for a long spell to get the last scrap out of the human structure**.
