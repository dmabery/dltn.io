Record has grooves.
Needle follows the grooves, which moves the magnet (or coil) inside the record player.
The movement of the magnet creates a current in the coil (Faraday) because a change in the magnetic field creates a current.
That current is sent to the amplifier.
Boom.

#### Farday's Law of Induction
1. Whenever there is a change in the magnetic flux linked with a coil, and electromotive force (em.f) is induced.
2. The strength of the emf, is directly proportional to how fast the magnet is moved away from the coil. (simplified)


### what is sound

A sound waveform has the same characteristics as that of an electrical waveform which are **Wavelength** (λ), **Frequency** (ƒ) and **Velocity** (m/s). Both the sounds frequency and wave shape are determined by the origin or vibration that originally produced the sound


### how the sound gets in the record


A record's groove – and there is generally just one that spirals gently to the centre of the disc – is tiny, usually around 0.04-0.08mm wide (depending on the level of the signal). If you were to unravel it, the groove on a 12-inch LP would extend to a length of about 500 metres.

The two sides of the groove sit at right-angles to each other, with the point of that angle facing down. Each side of the groove carries what can only be described as wiggles that represent the right- and left-channel audio information.

The side closest to the outside edge of the record carries the right-channel signal. This information can be stored in an area as small as a micron (one-thousandth of a millimetre), so the scale of the task to retrieve it is immense.

This also explains the sensitivity of record players to external vibrations and other disturbances.

The nature and degree of the stylus’s movement is what translates into the varying frequencies and volume that you hear through the speakers.

What exactly does a phono stage do? The physical limitations of vinyl mean that the original signal has to be altered before it can be recorded – low frequencies are reduced in level and the highs are boosted.

The curve that governs this equalisation was set by the RIAA (Record Industry Association of America) years ago. If you’ve ever plugged a turntable directly into a line-level input you know you get a very quiet sound – and also one that is thin and bright, with no bass frequencies to speak of.

Every phono stage has the reverse response built into it – one that boosts bass and flattens treble to exactly the right degree. The result should be a tonally even presentation.

Vinyl records have replaced Berliner's rubber discs. Easy to mass produce, master recordings are copied by placing a lacquer on a record-cutting machine. The master copy sends electrical signals to the turning record-cutting machine through a cutting head, which holds a stylus and cuts a groove in the lacquer that coils to the middle of the round disc. The cut lacquer is sent to a production company where it is covered in metal to make a metal master copy. This disc is a negative imprint of the lacquer and is ridged, not grooved. The metal master is used to make a metal record to be used to make the stamper, a negative of the end product. The stamper is put on a hydraulic press with vinyl between the plates. The vinyl is softened with steam, stamped and cooled off with water to create a finished vinyl record.

 The needle, or stylus of a record player is one of several parts that make up a transducer. A transducer is what changes mechanical energy into electrical energy and changes electrical energy into mechanical energy. The whole system contains a stylus, magnets, coils, cantilever, and a body within a cartridge. The mechanical energy from the sound waves is converted into electrical energy, which is then sent into the amplifier and out to the speakers.

 The stylus creates an acoustic wave made from mechanical vibrations.

 **If you runb your nail along a desk or chalkboard, you're essentially doing what a record player is doing. There just isn't any beautiful notes to it because the surface is one constant vibration, which is why the sound is the same sound. If you run your finer over a water bottle with grooves in it, you can hear the sound fluctuate and make somewhat of a more tone. This is how a record player reads the grooves in records. The fancy part of record player is really the amplifier.**

 there's a transducer in the part of the record player that you don't see. This is where the sound waves from the tone arm get converted to an electrical signal. 

 A sound transducer in a loudspeaker generates sound waves from electrical energy. So energy is transformed from one form into energy of another form: from an electric current to wave-shaped changes in air pressure (sound).


This signal is an “electrical image” representing the characteristics of the acoustic waveform.

#### how the amplifier 
https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/io/io_8.html
As the voice coil is permanently attached to the cone/diaphragm this also moves in tandem and its movement causes a disturbance in the air around it thus producing a sound or note.
### the phonograph

Sound waves were directed into the diaphragm, making it vibrate. A hand crank turned the cylinder to rotate the tinfoil cylinder while the needle cut a groove into it to record the sound vibrations from the diaphragm.

---

The stylus is set at one end of the tone arm, which is set at the side of the turntable, parallel to the record, and moves across the record while the stylus follows the spiral groove. The stylus picks up vibrations as it moves through the grooves of recorded sound, and those vibrations travel along the metal band at the end of the tone arm, to wires in a cartridge at the end of the arm. A coil in a magnetic field turns the vibrations into electrical signals, which are carried along wires to the amplifier. These boosted signals are finally turned back into sound through the speakers, producing the sounds and music recorded on vinyl records.

### Cool facts
First record player launched in 1948 via Columbia records


Incidentally, this is exactly how noise-cancelling headphones work! They record the ambient noise around the headphones, offset its phase by 180 degrees, and mix it in with the sound coming out of the headphone's speakers. This "cancels out" the background noise, just as the 180-degree sine wave cancels out the original sine wave.

# How we got to now...

> In March 1857, two decades before Thomas Edison would invent the phonograph, the French patent office awarded Scott a patent for a machine that recorded sound. Scott’s contraption funneled sound waves through a hornlike apparatus that ended with a membrane of parchment. Sound waves would trigger vibrations in the parchment, which would then be transmitted to a stylus made of pig’s bristle. The stylus would etch out the waves on a page darkened by the carbon of lampblack. He called his invention the “phonautograph”: the self-writing...

But that device didn't have the ability to playback the sound it was recorded! Some could say he forgot to add that. Others could argue that there's no reasonable way he could have thought of something to include to playback at all!
