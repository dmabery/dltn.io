I've all but removed "prescriptive" books from my reading list. Partly because I read so many when I first started reading, many are reductions of the same ideas. Also, most of those books can be learned from summary tools. You can't summarize an 800-page biography of Lincoln, his cabinet, and how he governed during the Civil War, so I gravitate toward books like those. I've challenged myself in this though: most story-books do have prescriptive lessons, they are just disguised. For example, a leadership book might summarize a story from Lincoln and how he got people to do what he wanted. In this way, the author does the hard work for you and gives you ideas: When faced with a challenge from someone you respect, first do A, then B, then C. I've found it's hard to truly understand the lessons this way compared to reading a sub-story in a biography that spans twenty pages and asking yourself, "How did Lincoln deal with the push-back from his cabinet but still push through the measure he wanted, without upsetting everyone else and making sure they felt heard?" The latter allows you to make sure you understand the history, which is always an added bonus but also ensures you understand the intricacies of the lesson. Not all square pegs can go into square holes. By seeing the "background" that the leadership book author usually is forced to leave out, you develop a better understanding of the story and can therefore judge situations better in which that "lesson" applies. This is a lot of work, and most people are comfortable just reading the book and picking up another one. But I love bio and history, and also love to learn practical insights. This is a way to do both.
