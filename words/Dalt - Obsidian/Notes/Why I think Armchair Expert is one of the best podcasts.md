# Why I think Armchair Expert is one of the best podcasts

*Armchair Expert* is the perfect balance between knowledge and stress-free humor. They have guests on, sometimes actors but sometimes professors and authors, and they get to ask them about the messiness of being human.

But it's not a dry, Q&A. It's a dynamic conversation between the guests and Dax and Monica.

There's also a massive community factor. Dax and Monica have a lot of inside jokes that get brought up in multiple episodes. As a listener, it's really satisfying to have an inside joke with podcast hosts. It makes you feel like you're sitting in the room with them and they are your best friend.

They also do a fun fact check at the end of each episode, something I haven't seen any other podcast do. They fact check what the guest said, but they also just talk about whatever and have a fun for 20 minutes after each episode. This is where you really get to know Dax and Monica and feel like they are your friend.

It's the perfect storm for what a podcast should be: funny, informative, and you get the feeling that the host(s) is/are your best friend(s).
