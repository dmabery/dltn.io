As of right now, I'm admitted to McGeorge School of Law. I went to an admitted students day last week and I absolutely loved it, but the thought of not working for three years (and therefore not having an income) terrifies me.

This all started because I look at my skills and realize what I have is helpful, but not necessary. Yes, things need to look good, but a lot of people think they know how to design stuff. Also, I didn't really "choose" my career, I kind of fell into it. Doors kept opening by sticking to the design/video route, and so I just kept walking through them.

I know I love words, books, and ideas, and I think I want a vocation that allows me to explore that, and be challenged a bit more than I am currently being challenged now.

I know I'm ready for a change. Below are three options I see. These aren't the only three options, but they are the ones I'm evaluating at this time.

## 1 - Go the law school

This is simple. I leave FS in July and enroll full time in law school.

### Pros

A total career switch. For the next three years, I can focus completely on reading, writing, and learning the law (and history) while using what I know from work at Farnam Street (mental models and such) in a completely new field. If I excel in school, I will be set up for a good, lucrative career with a lot of doors open for me upon graduation.

Learning every day excites me, and the idea of switching careers give me energy and a drive. The day to day of school and classwork I think I'll enjoy, and learning the ins and outs of the law, and practicing when I finish, I think I will love.

(The salaries floating around online for lawyers and associates are tempting. I'm pretending I'm not impacted by those numbers, but it's hard to say that when you see 115k for a first year associate.)

### Cons

Not working for three years is terrifying. Mainly, K does not make enough money for the both of us to live comfortably if I stop making money. If something happens to K, and she has to stop working completely, we will have no income other than from student loans. (As of now, I do not know what that money will be per month. That would help out a lot. I need to ask student financial services this question.) (Also, I could try to get clients lined up now so if I decide to do this, I can make at least some money on the side from school.)

I might hate law school. I love to read and write, but doing it because I want to and doing it because I have to are very different things. The pace at which I'll have to live might be too much for me and I won't be able to take care of Kendal like I do now. The flexibility with work right now, if Kendal gets sick, is amazing. I'll have a bit of that with school, but not much. And days spent in the hospital will be much more stressful than they currently are.

I might hate being a lawyer. In three years, I could be miserable and in a lot of debt poised to do something that I don't really enjoy doing. (How can I mitigate this? Talk to D's dad.)

McGeorge doesn't have the best online reputation. I may not have as good as career prospects as I would if I wait a year, retake the LSAT, and apply to Davis to try and get more scholarship money.

Debt.

Update - 06/07/2024 - SP agreed to keep me at FS part time to handle the admin side of the podcast for 2k/month. That will be devoted to a savings account and unexpected expenses every month. I feel good about that because if something happens with Kendal, we'll have money in the bank. I'm trying to get Thrive to pay me 1k/month for editing and Bayside Auburn is already paying me 400/month for slides.

My biggest worry about school was the financial aspect of it. Having all of this worked out makes me feel much more prepared and better!

## 2 - Leave FS and get a new video editor/design/marketing job

This excites me as well. I know I'm ready for a change, but maybe the change of Law School is too much right now. Perhaps I should try and get a job with a different company doing something similar to what I'm doing now, and see what happens?

### Pros

The upside is that a change of pace will be good, and perhaps the work I'll be doing at the new company will be very exciting and I'll meet a lot of new, smart people. (This is something I miss from FS right now.)

I get the benefit of the change along with the benefit of making money (as opposed to going into debt for school.)

Working a remote full-time job would allow me to position myself for the future better. I could work full-time, but still freelance on the side for various projects, make more money, and build my client base, so I had more of a runway if/when I jumped out on my own to do my own agency.

### Cons

The job might be more demanding than Farnam Street, and I might be working more with more stress. Starting at a new company puts me at a higher risk for being laid off if they need to get rid of people (last in, first out type deal). I could be pigeoned holed as "just the video editor" and not be allowed to work on more than one area of the company (which I would hate.)

The company could be less flexible than the current thing i have going with FS, which would make caring for Kendal difficult.

## 3 - Start a video/design agency doing podcasts

### Pros

The upside here is limitless. If I can get a few clients, I can make a good chunk of change while doing something that I find tolerable and not having the burden of not being able to do more side gigs and other jobs when they come up. I could set my own hours, and learn what it takes to truly run a business.

Using my relationship with FS, I'm sure I can have them as my first client. Potentially Thrive School/Bayside as well. Can reach out to MR and JC on Twitter and see if I can help him out in anyway.

Would have flexibility to care for Kendal when things came up.

### Cons

Limitless downside. I could struggle to find clients and become broke. There are a lot of legal/tax rules I'd need to figure out, and it would take a bit of money to file the right paperwork, and the get the right software/gear. I don't love the idea of hiring editors to try and manage.

I guess if it didn't work, I could always go back to try to find a video editor/design job at a company.

If I did have to take care of Kendal, it would be hard to take a step back and be there for her like I was post-transplant because then, I kept cashing my work checks, no matter how little I did. That wouldn't be the case if I decided to do my own agency at first. I would be strapped for time and I'd have to sit and edit to make money.
