> For this purpose [to stay in-step with the younger lads in the government] I had recourse to a method of life which had been forced upon me at the Admiralty in 1914 and 1915, and which I found greatly extended my daily capacity for work. I always went to bed at least for one hour as early as possible in the afternoon and exploited to the full my happy gift of falling almost immediately into deep sleep. By this means I was able to press a day and a half's work into one. Nature had not intended mankind to work from eight in the morning until midnight without that refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts twenty minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces. I regretted having to send myself to bed like a child every afternoon, but I was rewarded by being able to work through the night until two or even later – sometimes much later – in the morning, and begin the new day between eight and nine o'clock. This routine I observed throughout the war, and I commend it to others if and when they find it necessary for a long spell to get the last scrap out of the human structure.

This is antethical to [[The Law of the Conservation of Productivity]], but with Churchill's unique roll, I think it makes sense. He wasn't working all hours of the day because he *needed* to be creating stuff or *working,* rather, stuff came in at all hours of the day/night that needed his attention. This is the difference between a manager and a maker. A manager has the luxury of working 12 hours/day because it's the nature of their job; makers will be asking questions and shipping things all hours of the day. But an individual maker can only work 4-5 hours/day because of the nature of their job. Even if they put in more hours, they won't *make* more stuff. [[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule]]
