# Thinking and working in seasons
I read about this concept in a newsletter from Nat Eliason and have seen it around other places as well.

The basic idea is that most things in the world work in seasons. Farming, weather, biology, and so on. So why shouldn't we work in seasons as well?

The example Nat gave was about reading much more and much wider in the winter months and doing more working/executing during the summer (i think).

I like that idea because you have something to look forward to. It also allows you the opportunity to go deep in areas, which is often the best way to learn something.

As I'm writing this, I'm working on coding, reading, and writing, but I've thought about going all in on one area for a few months, emerging, choosing a new area, and repeating that cycle.

It would allow much more time in my life for "play" and would let me absorb the details that I don't normally get to by balancing so many things at once (not saying that's smart, just what I do.)

I got [[The Story of Civilization]] and [[Memoirs of the Second World War]] for Christmas, and they are both hefty reads, requiring a lot of time and study, especially SoC. It'd be great to study that book for a quarter, take a quarter off and repeat. Maybe I'll try something like that? This would be great to do if I become a full-time researcher (crossing fingers).

Reminds me of how [[Cal Newpor]] teaches one semester and researches/writes papers the other - or at least how he describes it in [[deep work]].

The seasons' idea could also be used in a lesser timeframe. Similar to how [[Basecamp]] works in six-week sprints for features and then takes two weeks to slow and review their work. I could work for 6-8 weeks intensely and then take two weeks off to recover. Not full-stop work, I don't think I could ever really do that, but maybe just sleeping in for those two-weeks and watching a bit more movies than usual.
