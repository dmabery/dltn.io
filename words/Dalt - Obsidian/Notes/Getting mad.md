Twice over the weekend, I found myself being frustrated with someone because they didn't come through like they said they would have. It took a lot of strength not to get upset with them in the moment. "You said you would do this, why are you waiting until the last minute?!" I kept asking myself while fighting back the urge to erupt the same sentiment at them.

But for some reason, I didn't.* I knew it would've made me feel better in the moment, but I also knew it wouldn't fix the problem. In fact, it would've probably made it worse. Actually, it definitely would've made it worse. It always does! (Don't create a horse storm.)

So, we thought for a bit about what to try instead, tried that, and it worked perfectly fine.

This made me think: solve the problem first, address the mistake later.

Solving the problem first does two things:

1. It takes your frustration out on the problem that needs solving, not on the person who made the mistake. Instead of letting anger pent up inside of you, you can release it by attacking the problem.
   
   An emotional outburst can ruin your reputation or relationship with someone in seconds. "At first," [Robert Greene writes](https://x.com/dltnio/status/1753577035639947295), "it may strike fear and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm clears, other responses emergeâ€”embarrassment and uneasiness about the shouter's capacity for going out of control, and resentment of what has been said...To show your frustration...is the helpless action of the child who resorts to hysterical fit to get his way."
   
2. Actually solves the problem. If someone made a mistake, something about the current state of affairs is wrong. If the mistake is big enough to get upset about, the problem is important enough to be fixed as soon as possible. Even after you lash out on the person who made the mistake, guess what? There's still a problem! Now you have even *less* time to solve the problem than you did before.

Addressing the mistake later ensures the conversation is tactical, not emotional. A tactical conversation seeks to find out what went wrong, why the mistake was made, and how to prevent other mistakes like it in the future. An emotional conversation does nothing but hurt the feelings of one person and make the other look like an idiot.

Solve the problem first, address the mistake later.

And remember: **if it won't matter tomorrow, it's not worth getting upset about today.**
