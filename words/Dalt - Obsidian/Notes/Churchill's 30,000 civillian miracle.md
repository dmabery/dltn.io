# Churchill's 30,000 civillian miracle
During World War 2, Winston Churchill sent for 30,000 civilian boats to pick up soldiers on the shores on Dunkirk. They were trapped there by the Germans and had nowhere to go. They had the ocean on one side and the Germans on the other.

Destroyers and other large ships couldn't get close enough to the shore, and there weren't enough ferries to shuttle soldiers back and forth.

So he made a call to anyone on the otherside of the bay with any type of vessel to go across the channel and pick up soldiers. And they did.
