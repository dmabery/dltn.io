# All great books are mysteriesAll great booksâ€“at their coreâ€“**are mysteries.**

The author reveals one piece of the puzzle at a time, allowing you to fill in the edge pieces, work on each section, and then put everything together at the very end to see the picture from above. Sometimes, you're blown away at how the pieces fit together and at the beauty of the image. But others, you're a little underwhelmed at the dullness of the final image. That's okay. It's still a mystery, just a bad one.

Non-fiction books give you a small bit of the answer in each section, leaving out the connections until the end when they reveal their mystery.

Articles give you bits of quotes and anecdotes until they tie everything together with a cute bow in the last paragraph.

This was a shocking discovery for me when I first read about the idea in _What We See When We Read_ by Peter Mendelsund. Shocking not because I didn't know it, but shocking because I didn't _think_ it. That's a big difference.

This concept really hit me when I thought about how it can apply to life in general. My life is one big mystery. Each piece is coming together one-by-one for a final glance at the end. Sometimes a lot of pieces come at once and other times it's a slower season. Sometimes when I get new pieces, I know exactly where to put Other times, I set them off to the side until I know where they're supposed to go. Sometimes pieces I've already put down disappear!

No matter what happens, I hope my picture at the end isn't dull when it comes together.
