Christmas is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ. It's a great story about hardship, mangers, wise men, frankincense, and myrrh. But the Christmas message is more than just a home video of Jesus' birth. It is a perfect example of the attitude God desires his followers to have every day.

As J.I. Packer writes, the Christmas message means that there "is hope for a ruined humanity–hope of pardon, hope of peace with God, hope of glory–because at the Father's will Jesus Christ became poor and was born in a stable so that thirty years later he might hang on a cross. It is the most wonderful message that the world has ever heard, or will hear."

Christmas is when Jesus, the Son of the Living God, emptied himself and became poor, put aside the glory of God and accepted the malice, humiliation, and horrific death that would eventually come.

Think about how wild that is for a second: Jesus, who has so far lived eternally with God in Heaven, seated at his right hand in all of his glory and power, all of the sudden...is in a manger? That's crazy.

But it's the perfect example of the attitude Jesus had while he walked the earth, and more importantly, it's the attitude Jesus desires all of his followers to have as well. 

That's the importance of the Christmas message: it is one of Christ's first examples of what it means to live as a follower of God.

It's a message about making yourself poor–"spending and being spent–to enrich your fellow humans, giving time, trouble, care and concern, to do good to others–and not just your own friends–in whatever way there seems need," just as Jesus did when he appeared on this Earth.

So, let's be clear: Christmas is far more than a charming tale of the start of Christ's earthly sojourn. It's a blueprint for living your life in tandem with Christ, a life marked not just by the receiving of gifts but by the giving of oneself. Christmas is not just a story; it's a state of being, a way of living, and a path to follow.
