I've long been stuck with this idea.

In one sense, a decision poorly made that turned out good shouldn't be praised as making a good decision. But shouldn't it? Isn't that exactly what a good decision is?

If you go through your 9-step program for making a decision to buy a stock, decide it's the right choice, and find out the next week the company is a fraud and the stock goes to zero and you lose all your money, that wasn't a good decision. You shouldn't have bought that stock.

[[Jason Fried]] tells the story about Musk finding a crack in the skirt that surrounds an engine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9NfQOd9JE). If it were NASA, the launch would have to have been delayed by three months and a whole thing would happen. But Musk asked if they could just get rid of the crack., and if so, what would happen. They could, and they'd lose some propulsion, but it wasn't enough to cause any problems. So they got rid of the crack and launched successfuly.

But what if the rocket blew up?

Fried says the story is a perfect example of great problem solving. But only because the rocket didn't blow up. If the rocket blew up, would it have been an example of great problem solving? Or would it have been a warning to take your time?

There's a video out there about someone stealing every base. It's praised as smart baseball, but if were tagged out at home plate, would it have been praised as smart baseball?

Adam Grant has a quote that we need to stop rewarding bad decisions with good outcomes, but again, isn't that all that a decision is, what happens after it's made?
