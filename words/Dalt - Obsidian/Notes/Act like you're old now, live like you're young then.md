Some advice for your future self: “If I knew I was going to live this long, I’d have taken better care of myself.” — Mickey Mantle

I've never met an older person who wishes they were in worse shape. Every old person is a warning to your future self. You can either follow the pattern and end up just like they did, or you can do something different. But you can't expect to do the same things they did when they were your age, and expect a different result when you're their age.
