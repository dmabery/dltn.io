im six years early on this, because this has been my play since college. black pants, black shirts, white sneakers. if it's cold, I have one sweater I'll wear. If it's just a bit chilly, I'll wear a flannel over the t shirt. I have one jacket I wear when I take my dog out, and one pair of joggers I wear at home. when my white sneakers get dirty, I buy brand new ones of the exact same type

my wife sometimes spends an hour more deciding what to wear to work or church or dinner. I haven't thought "hmm what should I wear today" in years.
