# Writing a+ work compared to a- work is a 100x difference
From [[Tim Urban]] on his reasoning for waiting to write posts and writing one, "Every sometimes." It's because he wants to write A+ work and the difference between A+ work and A- work is drastic. Someone writing an A+ article will spend an extra 4 hours on writing a small image that is a little delight, or doing extra research for just one paragraph.
