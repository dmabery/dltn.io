Feb 29 update -
	Sharing plain text posts or short ideas
		Monthly reading list email
		



- Think I need to do 3 things Friday, and then twice a week or even just once a month try to write a more in-depth original piece that gets shared. This will be natural marketing, and I can capture people with "Learn 3 things every Friday." This will also force me to keep putting pen to paper every week, but give me the chops to say "I'm a writer" with my original pieces. Could be narrative non-fiction style pieces to, with stories taken from books, or ideas I'm thinking about, or annotated essays from the olden days.

- Could be something like this 3 minute monday...
	- just three simple things I learned that week! I *love* that idea. Could be quotes, graphics, frameworks, ideas, whatever!
	- Could do this, change my site back to the way it was, and then add a sidebar for page layouts, that way it looks a bit more put together on blog post pages.
	- Or keep the site just like it is....
- Simple, plain text style in ConvertKit
- **Periodic Ideas and insights like** [[Stephan Ango]] does, plus include new book notes. In the email, I can send the bulleted insights, and link to the page with more context. I can also write the actionable insights posts *and* the rough book notes and share both of those in the email.
- **Monthly recap** of the best stories, books, articles, and podcasts I listened to that month
- I want to own my place on the internet. That means not using Substack.
- Quarterly book, article, podcast email! (Or monthly?)
- My blog and newsletter contains "working theories" about the world, history, and books?
