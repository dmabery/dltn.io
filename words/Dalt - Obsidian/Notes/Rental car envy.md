rental car envy: you have a nice car at home that you love, maybe it's even paid off. it has a few miles on it, but it still runs well. you're happy. but then you go on a trip and rent a brand new car with 4000 miles on it. the seats have heaters (and coolers). there's cameras everywhere during lane changes. it's so much smoother than you're ride at home. the trip ends. you get back in your old beater and notice how stiff the steering wheel feels, how uncomfortable the seats are, and how annoying it is you don't have a touch screen monitor. you're now unhappy.
