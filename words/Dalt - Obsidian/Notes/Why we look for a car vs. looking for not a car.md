# Why we look for a car vs. looking for not a car
Every day when I take my dog for a walk, I let her off-leash. On the way home, we come out of the woods and cross our quiet neighborhood street. And every day, instead of looking to see if there is a car, I always make sure there isn't one.

This is what I mean.

There are usually cars parked on the side of the street we're coming from, so it's hard to see around them and know if a car is coming our way. If there is a car, I always wait to let them pass because Sadie is off leash.

But instead of getting to a point and thinking, 'Okay, if a car *were* coming down the street, I would see it by now and since I don't see a car, I can walk forward knowing there is no car', I do this instead.

I walk *all the way out in the street* and make sure I can see to the very end of the road and *ensure* there is no car coming, even though if there was one I would have seen it wayyy earlier, before giving the okay to Sadie and letting her walk on home.

Why do I do that?

I want to make sure there isn't one, then see if there is. Am I being less risk averse? Because I'm not very risk-oriented, so that makes sense.

Is it nothing, and I'm thinking *wayyy* too deeply about this act? Maybe. But something about knowing the little psychology I know makes me think there is some sort of underlying thing going on, I just don't know what it is yet.
