It's a bit past mid year ([[08-08-2022]]) and I wanted to take some time to look back at my 2022 goals and check-in to examine any progress, failures, mistakes, etc. I had tweeted at the beginning of the year my goals, but I can't find it anymore. I do now I had three things as my priorities: Writing, coding, and excercising. Lesser-but-still-important priorities were reading and golfingâ€“two things I enjoy doing for rest but are still important enough for me to get better at them/ensure I'm still doing it to keep track of. I'll walk through each category to see where I'm at.

## Writing


## Coding


## Excercising



## Reading and golf
