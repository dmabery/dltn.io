# Higher mind and the primitive mind

**Higher Mind**
- More rational and puts out ideas that it's not attached to.
- When people's higher minds team up, they bring out ideas on balloons and then every shoots arrows at the balloons. The ideas that don't work, get popped, but the ones that are good and can stand the test of time deflect the arrows and live on.
- This allows a bunch of flawed scientists to create a super intelligence

But then, an idea gets deemed sacred and the primitive minds start to get involved...

## Primitive Mind
- The primitive mind gets involved in ideas it cares deeply about.
- When a bunch of primitive minds get together, no one can criticize the other anymore and if the idea is powerful enough, **no one can criticize.**
- Now the collective is dumber than the individual and no one will change their mind.

This is like [[Cancel Culture]] in regards to cancelling someone by what they believe/ask, not when they've just done something terribly wrong. It's happening with a lot of topics, especially in higher education. No one is allowed to take a nuanced view on something anymore.

Why aren't people looking at climate change and saying, "Let's solve this complicated problem together." But every idea gets tossed in the "red" or "blue" category and they'd rather fight with each other than fight the solution.

[[Attack the problem and not each other]]
