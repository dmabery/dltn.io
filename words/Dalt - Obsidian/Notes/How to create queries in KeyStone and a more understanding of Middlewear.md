KeystoneJS is the backend admin/CMS.
Mongoose/MongoDB Client is the actual backend. It holds all the data.
Our app is obviously the front-end.

We need something to talk to the database, Keystone, and our app - this is what middlewear does. In our instance, we're using Apollo Client - this is what we'll be using on the frontend.
