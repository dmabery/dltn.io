My thinking for these platforms: they're totally different.

  

CK is the way to go if your newsletter is separate from your online identity (you have a site that you regularly blog with, etc.)

  

If your newsletter is your "thing," and you don't post anywhere else, then Beehiiv.

  

Why:

  

If you already have a website getting traffic, splitting that between two sites (beehiiv's and your own) doesn't make sense.

  

If you want your newsletters to live on your personal blog, in case either platform ever disappears.

[[ConvertKit vs. Beehiiv shouldn't even be a conversation]]
