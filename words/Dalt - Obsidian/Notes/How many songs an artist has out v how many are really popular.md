# How many songs an artist has out v how many are really popular

[[Justin Bieber]] has about 300 songs (that I counted on Spotify) released. Of those 300 songs, only 8 have been Billboard Top 100 and about 25 of them have gotten regular plays on the radio.

Relate this back to something [[Tim Urban]] said on The Creative Elements Podcast. I can't remember exactly what it was.
