#notes/reading 
From [[Morgan Housel]]

> The best reading strategy I’ve come across is the idea of [a wide funnel and tight filter](https://collabfund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/). Be willing to read anything that looks even a little interesting, but abandon it quickly and without mercy if it’s not working for you.
