# Value consumption comes from memory

- A lot of the value consumption from good things in life (dessert, alcohol, TV) is either from memory or anticipation. Rarely is it from actually doing the thing.
- If you want dessert, you can get a very, very, very small scoop of ice cream and still enjoy the experience just as much - because most of the excitement comes from anticipating the first bite or remembering how good the first bite was. After that, each bite is just a diminishing return, so why not have as little as possible?
  
  This is the same for alcohol or watching TV.
[[Tyler Cowen]] gets the smallest ice cream he can because he recognizes this is how things work. #illustrations
