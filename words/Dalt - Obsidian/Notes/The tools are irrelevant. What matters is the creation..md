For enthusiasts, yes, it's cool to know what typewriter or fountain pen your favorite author used when writing their book.

But to most people, the tools are irrelevant, what matters is the output: the book, the art piece, the company.

It doesn't matter what programming language you use to build your company...if it makes money.

It doesn't matter what note-taking app you use...if you consistently have original insights.

It doesn't matter what running shoes you have...as long as you run well and are getting better every day (feet not hurting, good times, etc.)

The tools have never mattered.
