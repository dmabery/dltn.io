[[Albert Einstein's]] Theory of General Relativity explained how gravity is just warped time and space, commonly referred to as the more nerdy way, space-time.

Einstein essentially proved, through mathematical formulas, that matter warped space-time and that warped space-time directed the matter on how to move - creating gravity.

This can be illustrated through a simple thought experiment:

Imagine a trampoline with a bowling ball in the center. As you put the bowling ball down, it will "warp" the fabric of the trampoline. If you then put down billiard balls or marbles, they would respond to that warped fabric and drift toward the bowling ball.

That is how objects in space attract each other.

Time can be shown as warped by looking at atomic clocks. An atomic clock at the center of the Earth will tick slower than clocks further away from the center of the universe. That is because the stronger the gravity, the more it will warp. So time moves slower the closer you get to the center of Earth's core, where the gravitational pull is the strongest.
