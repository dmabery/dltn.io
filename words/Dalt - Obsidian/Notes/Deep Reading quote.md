Deep reading requires repetition. **The books I know best are those I’ve passed through multiple times.** I leave different kinds of notes at each stage. Doing so, I often think of something [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote in _Walden:_

> _Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written._

I don’t know that a reader could ever devote as much care and attention to a work as its author. But, just as great writing is often a matter of re-writing, great readers return to texts over and over again. We have the marginalia to prove it.
