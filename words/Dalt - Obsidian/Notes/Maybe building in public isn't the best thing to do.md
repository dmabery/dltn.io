# Maybe building in public isn't the best thing to do

Fame, money, etc. are the byproducts of building, creating, making something incredibly cool that people love. It's not the end goal. It's a by product of getting something completely different.

This is why it blows my mind that courses that teach people how to build an audience or grow their Twitter following is something that even exists. Anyone who takes those courses without already knowing, "I'm going to have to do something really hard to build an audience" is not going to build an audience.

Taking a course or learning how to do Twitter isn't bad, especially if you have something you want to create and showoff, but doing so just to build an audience is a horrible idea.

And you don't have to build the next Instagram or Spotify either. A newsletter, a YouTube channel, art, whatever it is, just be creating something.

This is one reason I've struggled as a creator, I don't want to commit to building something in the long run because I'm afraid of what I'll miss out on if I keep doing that. Though I feel good about writing and developing now, who knows where I'll be in the future. I let my YouTube channel die and now it's going to be really hard to get that started and going again, but there isn't much I can do.
