- Play chess, not checkers.
- Focus on the things I can control: effort and attitude
- Resist the hype and maintain quiet confidence.
- Hell yeah, or no
- A full no is better than a half committed yes. I’ll earn more respect saying no, then saying yes and not giving it my all.
- My identity is not in what I do, but in who God made me and how He sees me.
- I love what I do, but I maintain dispassion, lest I get too concerned with a success of a project and became frozen in case it fails.
- A failed project finished is better than one not started.
- Don’t get drunk, ever. I don’t want anything to inhibit how my brain is interpreting the real world. Emergencies happen, I want to be prepared and in sound mind to deal with it.
- Don’t eat desserts unless the bank is closed that day.
- Always be learning in public.
- Write everything down.
- Be interested. Understand, then try and be understood.
- More search, less feed.
- Look stuff up. Chase down every reference. Collect books I’ll never read. Get lost in bibliographies. **School myself.**
- Enjoy solitude.
- Always carry a book, a pen, and a notepad.
- Ask the question, often, _how could I be wrong?_
- There is an optimal amount of bullshit you must put up with if you want to understand how the real world actually works.
- Expect problems. Plan for them, but don’t try to predict them. If they come is inevitable, when they’ll come is impossible to predict.
    - Problems happening in life is inevitable. Something will go wrong. When they’ll go wrong, though, is impossible to predict, so always plan for them.
- Be a craftsman. Care about doing your job well, no matter how little the importance or how big of a project your undertaking. Craftsman care about millimeters. Be a craftsman. See George from [[The Boys in the Boat]]
- If I die young, I want to die happy. I want to be on my deathbed, sad that I'm leaving my friends and family, but happy that I *lived*, that I tried things, that I had fun, that I drank good coffee and read good books.
- Set and follow high standards. The main difference between most people are the standards they set for themselves.
