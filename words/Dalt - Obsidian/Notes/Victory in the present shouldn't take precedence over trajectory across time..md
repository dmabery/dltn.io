# Victory in the present shouldn't take precedence over trajectory across time.

Just because someone else may be "winning" now, doesn't mean they're always going to be "winning." They could be stuck in that position for 10 years.

Meanwhile, you may feel like you're "losing", but your trajectory is increasing with each passing year. Eventually, you're even with the person who was "winning" and after awhile, will surpass them.

That may be all well and good, but it's important then in the moment to ensure your upward trajectory. Keep learning. Keep working out.

Once someone gets somewhere, a lot of times they stop doing the very thing that got them there. Slowly, they drift from experience and don't know how to do the very thing they used to do on their free time.
