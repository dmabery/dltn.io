# Being a 'noticer' is what makes people great thinkers
One of the key attributes in Albert Einstein's life is his curiosity ([[Einstein - His Life and Universe]]). His willingness to ask questions about the strange mysteries in the world and see where his answers lead him. Without this bias toward asking questions, he might not have had such a revolutionary impact on science.

But that curiosity was rooted in noticing how the world works. The first instance of this is when he was sick in bed as a kid and was given a compass. He was fascinated with how the needle moved with the shift of the magnetic field and was determined to understand the process better.

The best books are the ones that combine ideas from separate domains and transfer them into one, overarching thesis. The reason these authors can create such great books, is that they have an act for noticing and being curious about the aspects of different fields people just assume work "because that's how they work."

You can explore this idea further in ["Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World."](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484)
