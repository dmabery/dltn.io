From [[Cosomological Considerations in the General Theory of Relativity]], one might ask, so what's on the other side of the universe? Though it's an interesting question, it can't be answered. If it's outside the realm of spacetime, then it's nothing (I think?) Or maybe it's something, but there's no way to answer that.
