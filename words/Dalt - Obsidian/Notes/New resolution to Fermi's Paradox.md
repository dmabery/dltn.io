Writing in the [Royal Society Open Science](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/04/27/lockdown-drove-60000-secondary-school-children-clinical-depression/), Dr Wong and Dr Bartlett said: “We propose a new resolution to the Fermi paradox: civilisations either collapse from burnout or redirect themselves to prioritising homeostasis, a state where cosmic expansion is no longer a goal, making them difficult to detect remotely.

“Either outcome — homeostatic awakening or civilisation collapse — would be consistent with the observed absence of (galactic-wide) civilisations.”

Basically, civilizations become so large that they just burn out as supply for innovation can't keep up with demand. The alternative to this is to stop when the civilization has hit a homestatic event. Therfore, not allowing for technical innovation to reach innner-planetary travel.
