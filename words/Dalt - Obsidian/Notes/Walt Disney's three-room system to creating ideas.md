# Walt Disney's three-room system to creating ideas
[[Walt Disney]] had three rooms in his home/office. Each room had its own specific function. This helped create a better atmosphere and helps your brain know, "Okay, I'm in room X, here's what I need to do." This is similar to the idea that [[You should only sleep in your bedroom and not work or watch TV]]

He had one room that was for creating ideas. Just whatever you thought of, write down, and come back to it later.

Another room was for showing how the ideas how would. How could we make this happen?

Finally, the third room was for showing why they won't work. This is where ideas go to die.
