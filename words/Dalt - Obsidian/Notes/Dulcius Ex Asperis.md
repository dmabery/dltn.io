# Sweeter after Difficulty
Some of the kindest people in the world often have no reason to be. They've faced horrible circumstances, tough situations, and unreal pain in their life that have reshaped their worldview and, very unexpectedly, made them kinder.

Like most virtues in life, there is a Latin phrase for this. *Dulcius Ex Asperis, sweeter after difficulty.*

In our case, *people* have become sweeter after difficulty. But that saying applies to much more than just people.

Victories won, projects completed, and relationships nurtured through difficulties are much sweeter than those that form without any obstacles. Other than the relationships, I'm not sure why this is. Relationships are sweeter after difficulty because the psychological effect of experiencing hardship with someone else brings two people together. But when a project is difficult and has a lot of obstacles, it too is much sweeter to complete and send off into the world compared to one that was more of a walk in the park. I wonder why that is.

It's important to have language for the experiences and emotions we feel because **our world is only as big as the language we have to describe it.** That's why it's important to learn, or at least be aware of, obscure Latin phrases and famous quotes that have been around for generations. They communicate something in a way no one has been able to communicate before, expanding our world one Latin phrase at a time.
