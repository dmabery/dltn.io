Mr. Best survivorship bias tweet here.

I think often about the buzz that must've permeated NASA, JPL, and other science-innovation companies during the 1960s. Given a lofty goal by a leader who wasn't given the time he deserved, they worked, and accomplished it.

What I wouldn't give to be a technical assistant during that time. To have such a clear end in mind—getting safely on the moon—and being surrounded by the smartest minds of the world would've been an electric environment to go to work every day in.

Sadly, I don't know if that is possible again because today, some of the smartest people don't have aims to go to space, though some do, but to make YouTube videos in their bedroom so they have "work life balance" and a "passive income."

That's so pathetic.
