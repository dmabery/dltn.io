# Masters aren't better, they're more consistent

"What separates 'The Best' from 'The Rest'"

A lot of people think that the most successful people in their field are 10x better than everyone else. I don' think that's true.

Instead, the best people in their field are just more consistent with their best output than everyone else. 

The best golfers in the world all play on the PGA tour. They're the top 1% of golfers.

But even within the Tour there are the best tour players and then there are the average players. And what separates these two aren't skill. They are all phenomenal players. They can all hit greens in regulation, sink long putts, and pull off the sexy escape shot when they need to.

What separates the best players in the world from the rest of the Tour is the likelihood they're able to pull off those long putts and escape shots. Average players might do it once every 5th opportunity and the best players might do it once every 2nd or 3rd opportunity.
