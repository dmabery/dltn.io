# Motivation is a myth

> **Motivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional state is necessary to complete a task.**

> **Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings _and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them_.**

> **Successful completion of tasks brings about the inner states that chronic procrastinators think they need to initiate tasks in the first place.**

> Put in simpler form, **you don’t wait until you’re in olympic form to start training. You train to get into olympic form.**

>The proper question is “How do I make my feelings inconsequential and do the things I consciously want to do without being a little bitch about it?”.

> Productivity has no requisite mental states. For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch.

> In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it.

> How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a positive feedback loop.
