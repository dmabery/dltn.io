What you can do (or avoid) tomorrow that would guarantee your being able to live longer?

In this episode, Bryan Johnson reveals the five simple disciplines you can start doing tomorrow if you want to live healthier and longer. Johnson shares what his daily routine looks like, the ins and outs of his experimentation process, and why he gave his father plasma.

Johnson also opens up about the constant hate he receives from people online, how he deals with it all, and what he wishes he'd known when he sold his company.

Bryan Johnson is the world's most measured human. Johnson sold his company to PayPal in 2013. Through his Project Blueprint, Johnson has achieved metabolic health equal to the top 1.5% of 18 year olds, inflammation 66% lower than the average 10 year old, and reduced his speed of aging by the equivalent of 31 years.

Project Blueprint, is an endeavor to achieve humanity and earth scale cooperation starting within Self. Johnson is also the founder of Kernel, creator of the worldâ€™s first mainstream non-invasive neuroimaging system; and OS Fund, where he invested $100M in the predictable engineering of atoms, molecules, and organisms.
