# Qualify your ideal user and find more of them!

From this [[Indie Hacker]]'s post: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/should-you-ask-founders-for-feedback-df1abb6363

Totally agree. I think most IHers come into this with that "mass marketing" mindset since that's what you're used to seeing from TV ads and YouTube sponsorships.

It takes a while to learn that marketing for regular people is all about figuring out what type of person already **wants** to buy your product/service, and then finding ways to make people in that group _aware_ of your solution.

No mass marketing, no "brand campaigns." Just [qualify your ideal user](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/forget-demographics-use-this-strategy-to-qualify-your-ideal-users-fb05935b93) and find ways to reach more of them!

This is what frustrated me with Bayside. We kept having to do these huge marketing campaigns trying to persuade people to come to church.
