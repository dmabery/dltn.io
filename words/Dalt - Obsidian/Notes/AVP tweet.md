An emotional outburst can ruin your career or relationship within seconds.

Aside from being kind and working hard, controlling your emotions is one of the most valuable things you can do to live a successful life.

But no one has ever been taught how to regulate their emotions.

Until now: AVP.

AVP stands for

Acknowledge
Validate
Permit

Becky Kennedy (tag) shared this framework on the latest episode of the podcast.

Here's how to do it step-by-step:

Step 1: acknowledge your emotions

Let's say your kid is whining. Instead of yelling at them, acknowledge what you feel.

"Oh, I'm feeling really annoyed right now."

Step 2: validate

Use the phrase, "That makes sense."

"I'm really annoyed right now because my kid is whining. 'That makes sense.' Whining is annoying."

The reason people have emotional outbursts is that their emotions have nowhere to go. When you yell, you feel better—for a moment—because those bottled up emotions are finally released. It's like a volcano.

When you validate your emotions, you're allowing them to live inside of your body. "It can live inside there. It has a place; it has a home."

Step 3: permit

Say to yourself, "I give myself full permission to be feeling this way."

It's okay to feel annoyed when your kid is whining. It makes sense you're feeling that way, and you have absolute permission to be feeling that way.

If you want to give yourself some added encouragement, you can add the phrase, "And I can cope with it" to the end of your permit statement.
