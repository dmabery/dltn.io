Watergate is a story of two separate criminal conspiracies: the Nixon world’s “dirty tricks” that led to the burglary on June 17, 1972, and then the subsequent wider cover-up…It was less an event than the way of life for the Nixon administration.

The most surprising thing to me about Watergate is that, since it’s called a “criminal conspiracy,” that there must have been some grand plan to deceive the public. But there never was. “Labeling it a ‘criminal conspiracy’ implies a level of forethought, planning, and precise execution that isn’t actually evident at any stage of the debacle. Instead, the key players slipped, fumbled, and stumbled their way from the White House to prison, often without ever seeming to make a conscious decision to join the cover-up.”

I suspect that’s how most moral failures occur. It’s not a black and white, day or night, “I’m going to do something against the law or morally wrong.” It’s a slippery slope. One tiny decision after another.

“It is the greatest story ever told about power–the need and hunger for it, the drive to protect it, how it is challenged, and how it flows month to month in a city governed by both well-calibrated checks and balances and all manner of official and unofficial traditions.”

To Nixon, the hardest part of the presidency seemed to be dealing with his aides and staff. “It would be god damn easy to run this office of you didn’t have to deal with people,” Nixon said.

Henry Kissinger, speaking along a similar vein, said, “I have never met such a gang of self-seeking bastards in my life. I used to find the Kennedy group unattractively narcissistic, but they were idealists. These people are real heels. I can’t explain how difficult it is to work around here. I am surrounded by maniacs in a madhouse.”

The immoral behavior started as a result of the Pentagon Papers. Nixon, pissed as he was someone leaked something to the press, made sure his staff knew they couldn’t let this happen again. Kissinger turned to J. Edgar Hoover. “Dr. Kissinger said they wondered whether I could make a major effort to find out where hat came from. I said I would,” Hoover wrote to his deputies after the fact. Hoover explained Kissinger wanted the FBI “to put whatever resources I need to find who did this” and “they will destroy whoever did this we can find him, no matter where he is.”

By the end of the day, Hoover had initiated several wiretaps to find the leaker.

When the FBI told Nixon some of their targets couldn’t be tapped, his staff outsourced the project to a former NYPD detective, Jack Caulfield.

Curiously, the Pentagon Papers had absolutely nothing to do with Nixon. They were an exposé into America’s push into Southeast Asia, led by Kennedy and LBJ, while Nixon was in New York. At first, the only thing that upset Nixon was that the top-secret papers were released, not necessarily the contents in them. It seemed for awhile the whole thing might just blow over.

But then Henry Kissinger got involved. He was livid at the blatant disrespect of the US press to publish top secret information. He told Nixon it made him looking like a “weakling.” Still, Nixon was unphased. But once the source, Daniel Ellsberg, was made known, Kissinger got more upset. Ellsberg was an old aide of Kissinger and someone he brought into the Nixon administration. This whole debacle made Kissinger, he felt, look like he didn’t know how to hire, so he kept pushing Nixon to do something. It threatened everything he and Nixon were working for, or that’s at least what Kissinger told Nixon.

“By Monday afternoon, the administration had decided to go to war with the Times as well as the man who leaked it.”

Nixon had the taping system the LBJ had in the Oval office torn out and then reinstalled. This time, it was handled by the Secret Service, so not many people knew about it. “From February 16, 1971 until July 12, 1973, the recording system would capture 3,432 hours of conversation, providing, as demanded, a look at Nixon’s mind and decision-making that was the most thorough and intimate view America has had of any of its presidents. It also would be the root cause of his downfall.”

The first burglarization was that of the Brookings Institute. There, laid a copy of the Huston Plan. Chuck Colson and Dean had the perfect plan, with Hunt. “I want the break-in,” Nixon said. “You’re to break into the place, rifle the files, and bring them in…Just go in and take it. Go in around eight or nine o’clock.” The next day, one of the first things Nixon did was ask Haldeman if they got “the Brookings Institute raided last night.” “No, sir. They didn’t,” Haldeman said. “Get it done! I want it done,” Nixon shouted. “I want the Brookings Institute safe cleaned out.”

“The Plumbers had been meant as a tool to stop the White House’s culture of leaking, secrecy, and paranoia, but rather than plugging the holes and ensuring Nixon a team worthy of trust, their six months of work had left a questionably trustworthy staff to fester and had further stretched (and broken) the ethical legal boundaries of the White House’s world.”

Colson later told a biographer, “It was like a culture taking root. You could always get rewarded if you showed up at the White House with a bit of negative intelligence, so the puppies kept coming in with their bones.”

**Lesson:** You get what you reward. People recognize incentives and try to act in accordance with those.

Gordon Liddy was the main driving force behind the immoral acts. He simply did what others wouldn’t and said what others couldn’t. He even got CIA-designed charts to explain many of his Operations: RUBY, COAL, QUARTZ, DIAMOND, GEMSTONE. Each Operation’s ideas were more and more wild and included yachts outfitted with spy equipment and prostitutes to lure leading Democratic nominees on-board, or messing with the air-conditioner of the Democrat’s office so they were forced to make speeches in Miami’s 100-degree heat. None of the plans were ever accepted, but not because of their intentions, because of the price tag. “Mithchell actuall was willing to accept a scaled-down plan in some form–the attorney general’s objection to the January GEMSTONE presentation truly was only about its scale and cost, not a philosophical objection toward dirty tricks.

John Dean should have trusted his gut with Liddy. “Liddy is a romantic,” he said. “Gordon needs guidance. Someone should keep an eye on him.” No one did; instead, they all just distanced themselves from his plans. Importantly though, “Nobody firmly told him no.”

Liddy even agreed to killing Jack Anderson, an annoying reporter who kept publishing his discoveries of top-secret material. “I know it violates the sensibilities of the innocent and tender-minded, but in the real-world, you sometimes have to employ extreme and extralegal methods to preserve the very system whose laws you’re violating,” Liddy said in an interview in 1980.

The Nixon team was even creative with the way they raised money. They had to be, though, because much of it was going to fund robberies and pay-off people from speaking-up about what they knew. Later, after the scandal was known, Butterfield, a participant in the money-laundering, said what he did never felt wrong, because, “When you work in the White House for the President of the United States, the last thing you think of is that you might be involved in wrongdoing.”

I feel that explains many people’s opinions.

The night of J. Edgar Hoover’s death, “Liddy, Hunt, and Barker’s team cased McGovern’s headquarters on Capitol Hill, studying the street lighting outside, and then Liddy took them to the new target Magruder had added to the OPAl list. ‘That’s our next job, Macho,’ he told Barker, pointing to the Watergate.”
