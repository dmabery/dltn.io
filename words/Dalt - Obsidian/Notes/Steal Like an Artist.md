# Steal Like an Artist

## Notes

- Look at the world through a lens of stealing. There is no good stuff or bad stuff, it’s just stuff, and the stuff can either be worth stealing or not worth stealing. Put another way, anything can be used as an influence into your creative work. Sometimes things influence you more than others, but almost anything can be used to invoke the muse if approached in the right way.
- Jonathan Lethem said when most people call something original, nine out of ten times they just don’t know the original sources that were used.
- “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” – André Gide
- An artist is a collector and curator, not a hoarder. Hoarder’s collect anything and everything they can get their hands on that _might_ be useful in the future (anything). Collectors, on the other hand, collect selectively. They know that which they collect now will influence what they create in the future, so they’re careful. If they collect bad stuff, they’re setting themselves up in the future to create more bad stuff.
- Here’s how to find original ideas: Study one thinker whom you’re inspired by. Study everything there is to know about them. Then, find three people they admired and were influenced by. Repeat this process. Climb up the creative tree as far as you can. “Once you build your tree,” Kleon says, “It’s time to start your own branch.”
- Look up **everything**. “Chase down every reference. God deeper than anybody else–that how you’ll get ahead.” Kleon calls this “Schooling yourself.” “It’s not the book that you start with, it’s the book that book leads you to.” Collect books, even if you don’t plan on reading them right away. There is nothing more important than an antilibrary. Just search.
- Artist David Hockney had all the inside pockets of his suit jackets tailored to fit a sketch notebook. The musician Arthur Russell liked to wear shirts with two front pockets so he could fill them with scraps of score sheets.
- Newspaper reporters call a swipe file a morgue file - why? “Your morgue file is where you keep the dead things that you’ll later reanimate in your work.”
- “It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.” – Mark Twain
- There are two ways to interpret the phrase ‘fake it ‘till you make it’
    - Pretend to be something you’re not until you are–fake it until you’re successful and everyone sees you the way you want to be seen, or
    - Pretend to be making something until you actually make it
        - You have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have. Similarly, you have to start doing the work you _want_ to be doing.
- “In the beginning, we learn by pretending to be our heroes.” Kleon says. As Salvador Dali puts it, those we do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.”
- “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!” – Cartoonist, Gary Panter. But don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. “You don’t want to look like your heroes,” says Kleon. “You want to think like your heroes.” Johnny Carson tried to be Jack Benny and became Johnny Carson. David Letterman tried to copy Johnny Carson and became David Lettermen. And Conan O’Brien became himself by trying to copy Letterman. “It is our failure to become our perceived ideal,” says O’Brien, “that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.” So, copy your heroes. See where you fall short or where you just have a natural inkling to do something different than they would and double down on that thing!
- The answer to every writer who asks what they should write is write what you know. That’s horrible advice! Write what you want to see! If you like a book, a movie, or a song, try and write a sequel. This is commonly called fan fiction, but you can call it whatever the hell you want to call it. If you like a movie, and are a video editor, try to cut a unique trailer. “Start the business you want to run….write the books you want to read…do the work you want to see done.
- “We don’t know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops.” A notebook is great for having ideas. A computer is great for developing ideas.
- Wonder at things. Wonder at things no one else wonders about.
- Surround yourself with books, objects, and things that transport you into a new world. Tape things on the wall. Create a portal to another dimension, the creative dimension. Make a time machine to the era you’re writing about. “All you need is a little space and a little time–a place to work and some time to do it.”
- Kleon has a philosophy that bad weather leads to better art. You don’t want to go outside, so you stay inside and make great work.
- Harold Ramis rule for success: “Find the most talented person in the room and go stand next to them.”
- “Modern art = I could do that + Yeah, but you didn’t.” – Craig Damrauer
- Be too busy to care about what people think. The critics and the fans.
- “Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time. Inertia is the death of creativity. You have to stay in the groove. When you get out of the groove, you start to dread the work, because you know it’s going to suck for awhile–it’s going to suck until you get back in the flow.” – Kleon
- The opposite of Parkinson’s Law is also true: “work gets done in the time available for it.”
- The way to get over creative blocks is to simply place some constraints on yourself. It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom.
- An abundance of opportunity kills creativity.

## Quotes

- You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let in your life.
- Your job is to collect good idea. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.
- I hang pictures of my favorite artists in my studio. They’re like friendly ghosts. I can almost feel them pushing me forward as I’m hunched over my desk.
- In the beginning, we learn by pretending to be our heroes.
