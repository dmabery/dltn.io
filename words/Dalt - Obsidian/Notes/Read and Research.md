I've got to carve out time every day to go through my books, podcasts, and articles and make highlights for. If I do that, I'll be able to send three insights around a theme to my newsletter.

I run out of material because I just don't do the work, and I've got to start doing the work more and more and more.

I can keep a running page in Obsidian about interesting quotes, stories, etc. I hear, so they are all in one place, and use Obsidian for long-form writing, book notes, or notes on an entire podcast or something.
