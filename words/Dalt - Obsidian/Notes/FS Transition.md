Shane,

I've decided to make a career change and am going to attend law school full time in August. My last day as a full time employee will be July 31.

I'd still love to be a part of the team, just as a part-time producer. Here's what I'm thinking, and how it will help you and the company:

I continue working full time over the summer. While I'm doing so, I'll be on the hunt for an exceptional video editor who can focus on making great trailers for YouTube. The only thing that will really change is someone else will be editing the full-length podcasts. Everything else will continue being the same.

When I start school, I'll move from an active editor to a producer. I'll manage the freelance video editor, and ensure Nick and Catherine have everything they need as well. I'll also continue making thumbnails and titles. For every podcast episode, I'll upload and schedule to YouTube. I'll also continue updating the website with new episodes and transcripts, and send the members only email.

I know you want to focus on things only you can do. With this plan, none of my work needs to be hired-out for, other than the video editing role. Everything else will continue working just as it has been, without you needing to spend time on it at all.

If you would rather go another direction, I totally understand. I've loved working here and I've loved learning from you. It's been a pleasure growing the channel to where it's at now, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it will go in the future.
