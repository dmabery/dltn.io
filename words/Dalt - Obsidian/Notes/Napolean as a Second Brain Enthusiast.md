"**The interior was organized with the same thoroughness Napoleon gave every other personal concern**.... Facing the seat was a cabinet with locked drawers for dispatches and references files, a map case, and a sliding leaf, which could be pulled out to make a convenient writing desk. There was one seat across the rear, divided by a partial partition, **so as to allow two passengers to work simultaneously without interfering with each other**, however rough the road."
