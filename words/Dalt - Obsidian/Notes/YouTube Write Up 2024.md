## Where we've been

During 2020, The Knowledge Project Channel gained a total of 558K views, 23,100 subscribers, and earned $3,775.66 in total revenue.

In 2023, the channel earned 4M views (+27% from 2022), gained 50,000 subscribers, and earned $27,163.33 in revenue (+13% from 2022).

Between those three years, many variables have changed, including: thumbnail templates, strategies for titles, posting clips and shorts (instead of posting clips on a separate channel), and the introduction of 60-second trailers to tease the episode and hook people to keep watching.

## What we've learned

### 1. YouTube is never "figured out"

The algorithm, the people watching the videos, and the way the videos are displayed, shared, and watched are constantly changing, so our strategies for getting views needs to constantly be changing.

In the summer/fall of 2022, after a wave of big guests that garnered us 35,000 subscribers or so, I did everything I could to repurpose the best segments into clips and shorts so the channel could ride the wave as long as possible.

At the beginning of 2023, we saw the channel views start to decrease and the "heavy hitters" who brought us views start to dwindle. This caused us to shift our strategy and migrate to posting Shorts, which was in vogue at the time.

We posted Shorts consistently for four months, but didn't have major success. A few videos took off, but most flopped. Our mistake was this: actually *posting* Shorts was half the battle. To win the war, we needed to be more selective about *what* we posted. The production quality wasn't a problem, it was the information being communicated.

The conversation between quality and quantity is never-ending between YouTube "gurus." The consensus is that newer channels need to focus on consistency, while more established channels need to focus on quality. My major mistake was continuing down the consistency philosophy when a quality one would have served us better. Instead of posting three Shorts per week, which was our goal, we should have instead spent more time digging through the archive, finding the best sections of interviews, and spending an unthinkable amount of time trying to position that clip for the most success. Because YouTube follows a power law (the 1% of the best content gets 99% of the views while the remaining 99% gets 1% of the views), a video that checks all the right boxes will perform exponentially better than a video that doesn't.

### Every podcast episode is a chance to get new viewers

Personally, I've come to realize that positioning a podcast episode with a guest or a topic that is less well known is the reason I'm here. Anyone who knows how to upload a YouTube video can post an interview with Andrew Huberman and get 50k views, because the people and the algorithm *love* Huberman. I used to think that expecting a video with someone less well known on YouTube to perform well was a fool's errand. I realize now that that's where the challenge (and the fun) of my job lies.

Take the latest interview with Blake Eastman. I did some research and couldn't find many interviews with him on YouTube (that's one sign he isn't as well known as past guests). "Okay," I thought to myself. "He may not be well known, but his knowledge is interesting and would be helpful for people to learn (he wouldn't be on if this wasn't true). How can I position this episode to perform the best it possibly can?" In other words, the popularity of a guest is not in my control, but what is in my control? A lot of things...

Since we had high-quality footage, I knew I'd be able to make trailer to put at the beginning of the episode. While I edited the interview, I marked up spots I thought would perform best in the trailer. For most interviews, it's hard to say how I think something will perform well. Often, I hear how a guest says something and just know that has to be included. This interview was different because there were two sections that I knew would get people interested: divorce and cheating. Rather than include the entire segment of those in the intro, I included just the set-up of the topic, but left the answer out, making people want to listen to the entire interview. This "opens a loop" of curiosity for people.

Once I have those sections, I combined them with others to allow the intro to flow well, set up the conversation, and get people interested. This is what the "creative work" looks like of positioning the video to perform well when editing.

This process flows through to the title and thumbnail. In this instance, having a pull quote saying "I knew they were cheating on their partner" was perfect. Other times, I have to get creative. For the Todd Herman video, I had to get more creative. I knew Todd Herman worked with Kobe to create the Mamba Mentality, and I thought that was the thing that would get someone to click on the interview the most. These are all things in our control.

Some imagine this a click-bait. In this instance, it wasn't. Click-bait is when you deliver on a promise in the title, thumbnail, or intro, that you don't deliver on. If I edited the episode to make it *sound* like Shane's uncle gave him a secret that predicted every divorce, that would be clickbait and, in my opinion, unethical.

### 3. YouTube is like the stock market and we can't compare our fund to other people's portfolios.

Sometimes there are bear runs, and sometimes there are bull runs. But if we keep throwing in 500/month for the S&P, we'll grow our portfolio in two, four, and six years. Just because we have a few months, or even a year, of lower-than-average views, subscribers, or revenue, does not mean the channel is dying. It might mean we have to rethink the process and figure out what's changed, but at any time a video we've posted can get thrown into the algorithm and the channel growth can hockey stick.

4. Upload details are important
(Shout out to Vicky for sending me this.) One reason our Shorts could not have gained traction was because I wasn't uploading them right. There is a tiny checkbox buried beneath two toggles in the uploading menu that say "Post to subscribers and notify." That box is automatically checked, but there's a huge problem with that. If the subscribers who are notified don't click on the video or watch it, the video isn't going to get shown to more people. "These people don't like it, so why would other people?"

When that box is unchecked, the video automatically gets posted in non-subscribers feeds. The people whose feeds are chosen are those who are most likely to watch the video based on the title. When they watch, the video gets shown to more and more people.




## Where we're going

## Next 30 days

We've already seen traction establish when all the "dials" on a video are in the right spot. The Blake Eastman video, despite being someone who isn't well known, is performing well because the first thirty seconds opens a loop that the viewer has to listen for it to close, the title and thumbnail are curiosity inducing, and the quality of the video itself is superb.

When one of those things are off, the results will show it.

## 1. Optimize past clips and episodes with titles and thumbnails

For our most popular videos, I'll go back and ensure the title and thumbnail are on par with what we've seen works.

## 2. Post more of what works

Make clips out of our most popular shorts and make shorts out of our most popular clips.

## 3. Ensure the trailers open a curiosity loop

Trailers aren't new for us. I've been making them for about a year. What is new, however, and what I'm learning to pull of, is to add suspense and drama in the trailer. Instead of including just the best one-liners or previews of topics, the trailer needs to include something that leaves the guest thinking "I *have* to watch that because I need to know the answer to that problem/question/situation right now."

## Long term

## 1. Keep doing what we're doing, but better

Keep doing exactly what we're doing, and recognize that there will be moments of low views and revenue followed by months of high views and high revenue.

My time would be spent editing the most engaging interview as possible, cutting out all of the fluff, and working hard to position the title, thumbnail, trailer, and social promo in the most engaging ways.

When we have an interview that's recorded in-person, I'll repurpose the interview a thousand different ways on social channels, trailers, and more to ensure we did everything we could to engage our audience and drive listeners/viewers.

When we have podcasts that have low-quality recordings or are audio-only, find one or two of the best segments to repurpose, and get creative with other types of video. This includes taking the guest's insights or quotes, and recording our own explainer videos. (Example 1 and 2.)

## 2. Once a month post exclusive, YouTube only videos

One handicap we face compared to other channels is posting once every two weeks, while other podcasts post once or week and sometimes multiples times per week. So, once a month, on a podcast off-week, we should post non-podcast content.

These can include YouTube-exclusive Q&As with Shane, or special behind-the-scenes content of booking, recording, and editing a podcast (day in the life style). We could also post rapid-fire questions with the guest and include guest-specific one-off videos. For example, if we have an expert on dating and relationships, we could field questions from members or on social media and do a rapid-fire question segment that's posted as a separate video from the main interview. Another type of content we could post is a TKP Insights style video, but instead of just including the guests segments of interviews, take their insights, make them more explicit, and combine them into a more traditional YouTube video (Example from Ali Abdaal's podcast).

All this focuses on the things we can control: ensuring titles, thumbnails, and trailers are smart, thought-through, and well-positioned, while capitalizing on the interviews with exceptional quality and being creative with the interviews that aren't as viable for content repurposing.

## 3. YouTube-specific sponsors (optional)

In terms of revenue, we need to book sponsors for the YouTube channel. Relying solely on Google Adsense is doable, but we're investing a lot of time and energy into YouTube, and we should be able to recoup our investment more on a per-episode basis. YouTube can be a place for companies or brands who pass on the normal TKP sponsorship to get in front of our audience for a reduced cost.

We say book three or six interviews, (one or two every month for a quarter) for a flat rate. Shane can film ad reads either in his office or with the film crew one time each quarter, and we I'll edit them into interviews respectively. We could do our best to match interviews with ad read topics. For example, nutrition companies might pay a hefty amount to be included into a podcast with Bryan Johnson, or other big name guests in the health space.









The basics we can control:
		- We can always be playing with titles and thumbnails from past episodes, and ensuring each clip we post and full-length podcast is immediately engaging from the start (adding the hook/trailer), and cutting out all of the fluff.
		- Posting at the time most of our subscribers are active and ensuring all posts on social media are going out within five minutes of the YouTube video going live so we get a big push in the first 10 minutes to an hour. Doing this doesn't have that much of an affect on the overall performance of a video. If a video is not interesting to our audience, it can be a 1/10 the first day, but then taper off. Alternatively, if the video is great and doesn't have the execution, it will get picked up in the algorithm, eventually. My job is to ensure the videos that will get picked up are picked up the quickest, and to position the episodes with guests that are less well known in the most interesting and engaging style.
- We also have control over the *types* of videos we make. We could do Q&As that are exclusive to YouTube once or twice a year (you can never have too many Q&As); special, rapid-fire questions at the end of an interview with guests who are well known and we have good video for; behind the scenes (how guests get booked, filming, research, editing, publish-day); if a guest is an expert in something tangible (coffee, fitness equipment, etc.), we could have them test variations on screen and decide which is the best one, for a separate piece of content all together; video compilations of the best insights on sleep, fitness, health, productivity, etc. Sort of like TKP Insights, but more explicit, and filmed like a traditional YouTube video. Ali Abdaal has a good example of this.
