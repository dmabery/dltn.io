# How to Take Notes
- Read, watch, or listen to something.
- Take [[literature notes]] on that thing. These are the typical style of notes most people think about. Jotting down stuff you want to remember or things that resonate.
- Go through the literature notes and look for ideas/concepts that can be turned into [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]].
- Add relevant tags to each [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]] as you see fit. A topic tag can be simple, like #science, or something abstract. Think of it as a, "Where do I want this note to resurface?"
- As a tag starts to get a lot of references around it, you can turn that into a [[Organizing Notes into Map of Contents|Map of Content]] and organize sources and sub topics within that theme.
- Now you have a topic that created itself, rather than having to store a note in a folder as soon as you create it.
	- [[The difference between Obsidian and other apps is that folders are emergent rather than divergent]]
