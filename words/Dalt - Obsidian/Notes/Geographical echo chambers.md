If people want to live in a diverse environment but *don't* like to be in the minority, the town naturally segregates. [[Tim Urban]] explains here and using this simulation: https://ncase.me/polygons/

>This exposes a stark fact: if easily mobile people like diversity but prefer not to be the _minority_ where they live, it leads to complete segregated homogeneity. Or as Case and Hart put it, ‚Äúsmall individual bias can lead to large collective bias.‚Äù The only way areas stay diverse‚Äîracially, ethnically, politically‚Äîis if people like diversity _more_ than they dislike being in the minority.

>Back to our story. The simulation suggests that if Baby Boomers were, on average, a few ‚Äúindividual political bias percentage‚Äù points higher than their parents, _and_ they were a bit more capable of moving and choosing their location, then when the Boomers reached home-buying age, the country would quickly sort itself into politically segregated neighborhoods in politically segregated counties.

> The ‚ÄúBig Sort‚Äù shows up in poll numbers. In an election, pollsters define a ‚Äúlandslide county‚Äù as one in which the winning candidate beat the losing candidate by 20 percentage points or more‚Äîin other words, a very red or very blue county. In the 1976 presidential election, 27% of Americans lived in landslide counties, with the remaining 73% living in more politically balanced counties where the election margin was closer.

> By 1992, the percentage of Americans living in a landslide county had moved from 27% to 39%. That number has continued to rise every election since, with the 2016 results showing that _61%_ of Americans now live in landslide counties.

> FiveThirtyEight [explains further](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/purple-america-has-all-but-disappeared/), writing about the 2016 presidential election:

> Of the nation‚Äôs 3,113 counties (or county equivalents), just 303 were decided by single-digit margins‚Äîless than 10 percent. In contrast, 1,096 counties fit that description in 1992, even though that election featured a wider national spread. During the same period, the number of_ **_extreme landslide counties_**_‚Äîthose decided by margins exceeding 50 percentage points‚Äîexploded from 93 to 1,196, or over a third of the nation‚Äôs counties. ‚Ä¶ The electorate‚Äôs move toward single-party geographic enclaves has been particularly pronounced at the extremes. Between 1992 and 2016, the share of voters living in extreme landslide counties quintupled from 4 percent to 21 percent._

> Landslide counties are bad for progress. According to _[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2008/06/19/the-big-sort)_, ‚ÄúVoters in landslide districts tend to elect more extreme members of Congress. Moderates who might otherwise run for office decide not to. Debates turn into shouting matches. Bitterly partisan lawmakers cannot reach the necessary consensus to fix long-term problems such as the tottering pensions and health-care systems.‚Äù
