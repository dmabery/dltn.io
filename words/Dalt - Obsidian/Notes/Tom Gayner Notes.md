03:12 - anytime you can do a favor for someone, do it...
- "There's 8 billion people on the planet, and I'm one of them. If I can get the other 7.9 billion to not even like me, but at least not hate me, that's a recipe for profound success."
- "You want companies that are doing things for their customers, rather than doing things to their customers." 10:47
- Biggest period of underperformance in my career - 20:00
- [[Be curious about the path you aren't taking]] - 28:05
	- When people decide to go down one path instead of another, they often map out the pros and cons of the path they're leaning towards, and use that to justify their actions. The other path is dwindled down to nothing. But that other path still exists. And it has pros and cons, and by choosing the other one, you're not choosing this one, and you need to know what it is you're *not* choosing – that is, what you're missing out on – just as well as you know what you are choosing.
- "resulting" 33:50 - from [[Annie Duke]]'s book [[Thinking in Bets]] - just because you won a hand of poker doesn't mean you played well. What was the process? How did you think? Did you just get a lucky hand?

- Avoid being in situations where the circumstances make the decision for you.
- To play the long term game, you have to be willing to look like an idiot in the short term.
- Risk - "More things can happen than will happen." 1:27:20 - "If this guy has a gun it will not end well"
- "You can never enter a good deal with a bad person" - is the opposite also true? Can you never enter into a bad deal with a good person?
- The biographies that have stood out to Gayner over the years
-  How simplicity is the superior management philosophy (and how to execute on that in a large company)

"You can never enter a good deal with a bad person" And Other Life Lessons I've Learned While Playing the Long Game





Book - The Kingdom of Prep


There are people who read and learn from Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, and then there's Tom Gayner. Gayner has applied Munger and Buffett's investing philosophy into an interesting business: Markel, a global financial holding company.

Gayner and Shane discuss the life lessons they've learned from Charlie Munger (including their first-hand observations during dinners and meetings), what to look for when evaluating the strength of a company, and the importance of evaluating your opportunity costs before making a decision. Gayner shares his philosophy about debt, why he disagrees with Charlie Munger about the value of reading fiction, and why simplicity is the superior management philosophy. He also talks about the importance of playing a long-term game in a short-term world, and how to overcome the obstacles of doing so. Plus, Shane and Gayner discuss the biographies that have had the most impact on their lives and thinking.
