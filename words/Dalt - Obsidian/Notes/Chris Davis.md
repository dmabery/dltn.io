- Money and life lessons learned from his grandfather and father


Our conversation with Chris Davis (investor, Berkshire board member) is available now. Davis discusses money and life lessons he learned from his grandfather, father, and Charlie Munger. Plus, we talk about raising kids with money, what makes for a horrible board meeting (and how to fix it), and what it takes to build wealth for three generations.

Here are some practical insights:

1.Writing clarifies your thinking. It doesn't matter who reads it, it matters how it helps you think. Write clearly to think clearly.

2.Reading physical copies of newspapers and magazines increases serendipity. You're more likely to read something that's not directly related to your work or life on paper than you are on an app. And often, those articles give you better insights.

3.Wealth creation is about staying in the game. You might be able to increase gains by leveraging your portfolio, but doing that can open you up to getting completely wiped out. Just stay in the game.

4.Charlie Munger had this idea called The Intelligent Loss of Sales: Operating a great business isn't about getting the maximum amount of people through your doors; it's about maximizing the returns you get from each person who does come through. Be okay with losing out.

5.Think about the causes of failure in your life and business and avoid those. It sounds simple, and it is, but few heed this advice. Those who do end up in great positions of success.

6.Moderation in all: Hemingway — it’s not finishing the bottle that gets you in trouble; it’s opening another one.

7."The most dangerous thing in the world with a 12-year-old is to try to be their friend. But the worst thing with a 40-year-old is to try to be their parent."

Berkshire Hathaway Board Member: Three Generations of Wealth (What My Family Did and Why)





Most families who obtain immense wealth squander it by the third generation. But Chris Davis comes from a family whose grandfather and father all become independently wealthy of each other, and Davis has done the same. How does that keep happening? In this conversation, we find out.

Shane and Chris discuss life and investment lessons he learned from his father and grandfather, why writing is more important to clarify one's thinking no matter who's reading it, and the surprising benefit of reading physical newspapers and wearing ties to work. Davis also shares his value-investing philosophy, what he learned from working with and meeting Charlie Munger, and what parents can do to not raise entitled kids. Davis talks about his alcohol drink tracker and why it's important to him, why he never puts himself in situations where envy can grow, and Warren Buffett's letter about why investment managers underperform.

**Metadata:** Chris Davis shares key ideas on building wealth and living well.






**He used to say, “You call 10 companies, you learn one thing; you call 20, you learn two.”**

**the writing is not about the product for the client; it’s about what you learn by writing for yourself.**


**If you really think the goal of work is to invest as little as you can in order to get as much payment as you can, of course it’s going to suck. And of course everybody’s going to cheat and you’re not going to have friendships and you’re not going to learn anything.**

**but it’s this idea that living this completely alienated life may not be a source of happiness after all.**


**But what I loved about reading a newspaper is that I wasn’t always sure where my eye was going to go, what I was going to focus on. And it was often the case that something might have caught my eye in a way that it doesn’t when I’m scrolling on this tiny little screen**

- Why I like hard copy magazines


**And you’re right, in the very long term, it should be the case that if you avoid the blowups, you make progress when the sun is out, but you don’t sink, then over time, it will just be a war of attrition. And it’s something that my friend Tom Gayner and I talk a lot about; it’s just staying in the game.**

- Just stay in the game

**the financial risk that people fear the most is this idea that somehow they lose their financial independence. And there is real dignity in that. There’s dignity in financial independence and there’s a loss of dignity in becoming beholden and becoming dependent. So I often think of risk around those things.**

**interest rates are really about you using a productive asset that belongs to somebody else and therefore needing to compensate them for the loss of that. So of course, for all of human history, money has a cost**

**The hardest teacher you’ve ever had is a tough critic, but you feel they’re rooting for you. That’s part of what makes them your favorite.**

**The intelligent loss of sales** - By pricing your product, or marketing it in a certain way, you're naturally excluding a group of people. Who are those people? Munger says the Costco membership keeps people who aren't organized enough to give their license and get their picture taken—or don't want to—out of the store. And those people would 100% be the people who either shoplift or just get low ticket items. So even if they end the membership program and raise prices, they may have ore customers but those customers aren't quality. And that's the intelligent loss of sales. You're choosing to forego sales from population group A on purpose.

[[Charlie Munger]] - **He said it’s one of the reasons he gave up being a lawyer. “Being a lawyer,” he said, “it’s tough because your best, your most profitable clients are going to be people that you don’t respect very much because they’re always operating right on the line. They always need a lawyer. They’re always trying to get around it, but your best clients will be your worst customers.”**

**so much of Charlie’s mind was about “Think about the causes of failure and try to avoid them.”**
	- What does failure look like in my life?
		- How do I avoid that?

**

And in fact, in our research department, we have a letter that Warren wrote in 1965, I think, that or ’66, that lists the reason that he believes most money managers, institutional managers, tend to underperform. And we framed that letter and put it on the wall in the research department because we said what we should do is just try to avoid these five things. And to the extent that we avoid these five things, we will over time be above average.

One was group decisions; that was number one. Number two was the desire to conform your portfolio and policies to what other large, well-regarded firms are doing. Three was the asymmetry of risk and reward. Obviously better to fail conventionally than succeed unconventionally. Four was over-diversification, and five was inertia.

**

**I have the motherlode of all ADD. I mean, you can probably tell; it’s very hard to keep me on topic. And that’s one of the reasons I love this business. Everything’s interesting; everything’s relevant. No matter what article I read, it has some tentacles back that have investment implications.**

	What profession can I choose where no matter what I read, learn, or am curious about, it imapacts it, or helps me perform better?

**work before play. That was my dad’s favorite expression, work before play. Well, it suits me, and it suits me whether it’s going to work or whether it’s going to exercise. There’s one thing on earth I love. I love a sauna, and so I only give myself a sauna after I work out. There’s no other way I can get a sauna. And so it’s amazing how effective that is in manipulating myself into doing something I don’t really feel like doing, which is going and exercising.**


**I love what Hemingway said: it’s not finishing the bottle that gets you in trouble; it’s opening another one. And there’s a lot to that, too.**
	#quotes 


**What doesn’t work is giving your kids a lifestyle where they will feel like a loser if they are unable to maintain that lifestyle on their own merit.**

- That is a profound idea.

Don't put yourself in situations where you won't be happy, or you know you'll be forced or have a desire to act in ways you don't want:

**

And so going back, I’m very prone to envy in myself. I’m not proud of that. I can be a very competitive person. And so a big part of checking that weakness in me is not to get in that pool. And so I don’t go to Southampton, not because I don’t think it would be lovely, and not because there aren’t some amazing, interesting people that I admire hugely that live there, and they live beautifully there. It’s because if I got there, I would feel like…

Shane Parrish: I want to be here.

Chris Davis: I gotta do this, and I gotta get a big house here. And then now what? Now my kids are all trying to figure out, well, can we get so…? Instead we literally have a campground in Maine, little cabins, and it’s a place that we’re very happy in because it feels sustainable. But my not going to Aspen is not because I don’t think I would love it. I know I would love it, and Southampton, Aspen, Palm Beach, I’m sure I would love it. Look, people are not crazy. If people go to Palm Beach, it’s because it’s pretty great, and they pay a lot of money to go there; it’s probably pretty great. I just feel like, Why do I want to get on that trolley? I feel like crystal meth is probably pretty great, too; I just think it’s probably better not to get started.**

**I’ve seen just as much damage done by wealthy families trying to build character as I’ve seen the opposite.**

**That’s what suffering is—an opportunity to behave well.**

**the most dangerous thing in the world with a 12-year-old is to try to be his friend. But the worst thing with a 40-year-old is to try to be their parent.**
