I used to like the phrase, "How you do anything is how you do everything."

Doing the little things right is important. But there's not enough time in the world to do *everything* well. Some things just need to be done.

You don't approach buying groceries the same way you approach creating and preparing for a big presentation at work. You *shouldn't* approach those things the same way. No matter how "well" you get your groceries, at the end of the day, if the groceries are in your pantry, you did your job.

Paying bills is like this too. Sure, there are ways to be efficient and strategic in the way you pay your bills, but all that matters is if your bills got paid. *How* they got paid doesn't matter.

I once read that a good measure of one's maturity is how organized their sock drawer was. Because people don't expect anyone to look at their sock drawer, having it organized shows they have integrity and care about doing the small things well. When I first learned that, I thought it was genius. But now I think it just means you spend too much time organizing your sock drawer.

Some things need to be done well; but most things just need to be done. Don't confuse the two.
