# But there is a big difference between cycling to work because you want to â€“ and doing so because you canâ€™t afford a car.

Signaling is all around us. Even when you don't think you're doing it, you're probably doing it. It's one of the reasons it's hard to try and get better at something, because to do so, you have to look like a fool. And no one wants to signal that they're a fool.

Perhaps we don't want to look like fools not because we don't want to feel like a fool, but we don't want to give off the impression that we are on. If the driving range or chipping green is empty, I'm much less likely to get embarrassed or upset by my bad performance because I know what I can do and just miss-hit one. But the thought of someone else seeing that miss hit and coming to the conclusion, "Wow, he's bad at golf" terrifies me.

If you cycle to work because you want to, that's a status signal. You can afford a bike. You are physically healthy enough to ride said bike over a great distance. You probably want people to see you riding your bike so they know how cool you are.

But if you ride a bike because you can't afford a car, you may not want anyone to see you. Perhaps you lock it up two blocks down the street and walk, getting everyone to believe you live down the corner. For lying is a great deal easier than having them see the real you. At least you think it is.
