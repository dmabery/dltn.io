# School teaches procrastination is okay. That's bad for later in life.

This may sound like a controversial idea and it also depends on one's definition of "success in life." I'm defining it as, **people who are doing what they want to be doing.**

School kinda teaches you that you can procrastinate and get by. You can usually wait until the last day or something to write a paper and get by with a B- or something. Not great, but enough to pass pretty easily.

There are two reasons why you do the task at all:
1. There is a consequence if not done. You'll fail.
2. There is a deadline that sets that consequence in motion. If the paper isn't turned in, run consequence program on student X.

But in life, none of those motivational factors are there for things you want to do.

Learning a new skill, traveling, changing careers, etc., don't have a "due date." So the habit you learned in school won't kick in, since there is no consequence and there is no deadline.
