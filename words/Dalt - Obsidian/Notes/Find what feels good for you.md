[[Rick Rubin]] didn't want to read ads on his podcast. He just didn't feel comfortable doing it. So instead, he got an AI bot of Orson Welles' voice and has AI Orson Welles read the ads on the podcast.

On YouTube, the ad reads are consistently the most watched part of his YouTube videos (you can see this on YouTube). It's a great lesson in doing things that no one else is doing, and taking something that's uncomfortable, putting your own spin on it, and making it comfortable.
