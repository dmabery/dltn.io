# Einstein's ability to detatch from people helped his creative ideas flourish
No one questioned what was more important to Einstein: His persona life or his science. He made that very clear.

He was cold. "I do not know anyone as lonely and detached as Einstein. His heart never bleeds, and he moves through life with mild enjoyment and emotional indifference." â€“ Leopold Infeld

But it was this "emotional indifference" that allowed his creative pursuits in science to flourish. The detachment led him to reject conventional scientific wisdom.

Isaacson writes on page 275 in [[Einstein: His Life and Universe]]:

> It is easier to be a nonconformist and rebel, both in science and in militaristic culture like Germany's, when you can detach yourself easily from others. 'The detachment enabled him to walk through life immersed in thought. It also allowed himâ€“or compelled himâ€“to pursue his theories in both a single-minded and single-handed manner.'

I resonate with this deeply... Part of it may be that I wish to have the same internal thoughts and feelings as one of the world's most creative geniuses. But part of it I relate with. I have no desire to get attached to people or be sociable when I'm in the midst of thinking about or working on something exciting. I'm not saying this is the right way to go through life, merely just how I feel and can understand Einstein's words. It's actually quite nice I know someone else feels that way.
