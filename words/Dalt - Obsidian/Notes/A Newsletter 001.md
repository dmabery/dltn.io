If you've been a subscriber to this newsletter for a while, you know the template has changed...a lot. If that's you, thanks for sticking around. It really means a lot.

It's hard to find a unique, interesting, and sustainable format to send out every week. Since I started this in 2020, I still haven't found one that "works." But that's fine because I've enjoyed experimenting.

Here's a new format: 7 things I think are worth sharing. I'm inspired by Austin Kleon's Friday newsletter, whom I admittedly stole the description from. He's been sending his newsletter for over a decade, and that's inspiring. I hope to continue mine for at least two!

Let me know what you think of the new format.

Also, I gave up on names for this newsletter, so now I'm just calling it _a newsletter_.

If you want to give up now and forget all about me, unsubscribe [​here​]({{ unsubscribe_url }}).

1. ### John Steinbeck's anti-advice for writers

"If there is a magic in story writing, and I am convinced there is, no one has ever been able to reduce it to a recipe that can be passed from one person to another. The formula seems to lie solely in the aching urge of the writer to convey something he feels important to the reader. If the writer has that urge, he may sometimes, but by no means always, find the way to do it. You must perceive the excellence that makes a good story good or the errors that make a bad story. For a bad story is only an ineffective story.”

3. ### Getting "the last scrap" out of yourself



John Steinbeck's anti-advice for aspiring writers: "If there is a magic in story writing, and I am convinced there is, no one has ever been able to reduce it to a recipe that can be passed from one person to another."

How someone treats another person when they're down says a lot about who they really are.

Winston Churchill smoke about 10 cigars a day and was hardly without a drink in his hand, yet he was at the top of his game during WW2. His trick for getting "the last scrap" out of his body? Naps. Read how Churchill himself described his process.

Letter writing is unfortunately a thing of the past, but it doesn't have to stay that way. Read a book from ---- about the proper ways to write a letter from X, Y, and Z. (I wonder how biographies will change in 200 years when most of a person's record is digital. It could either be horrible or amazing.)

An increased awareness of something does not mean an increased occurence of that thing. - https://x.com/xsphi/status/1750356528073261492?s=20

Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions before you start working on something. "Answers are free labor is not." - https://x.com/jasoncoxnc/status/1750526695592124907?s=20

Being able to walk through the invisible door without someone opening it for you will put you ahead of a lot of people. Don't wait for permission. You can just do things. https://x.com/pli_cachete/status/1749950768143016431?s=20

P.S. Please pre-order one of my favorite author's new books.  - https://x.com/exlarson/status/1750267762490945598?s=20
