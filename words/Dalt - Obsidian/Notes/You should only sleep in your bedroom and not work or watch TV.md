# You should only sleep in your bedroom and not work or watch TV
I forget where I heard this, but the idea is that you shouldn't work or watch tv or read in your bedroom and especially not your bed. When your body sees and lays in your bed, you want it to signal one thing: sleep. 

You also don't want to do work in your bed becuase then you'll be fighting your body from wanting to go to sleep to just keep working.
