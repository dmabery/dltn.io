# Pet Explanations
From [[Dan Shipper]] of [[Superorganizers]]:

> When we find a model of the world that works, we are tempted to apply it to every situation that comes up. Pet explanations make life simpler, and more understandable. They can make us feel more in control, and better equipped to handle our own lives. But, very often, they are wrong.

In other words, pet explanations seem to be another way of describing the [[Man with the hammer syndrome]] - assuming everything in life stems from one problem and can therefore be fixed with a simple solution. But reality is quite the contrary.

But like everything, there is a reason pet explanations are popular.

The image above illustrates where to look for the cause of something based on a certain behavior. Dan points out in his article that when you look at a behavior, you have to sort through neurobiology, psychology, and on and on down the chain. Pet explanations help you simplify the world and "recognize patterns" that typically fit your situation.
