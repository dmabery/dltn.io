A method of showing how wrong a premise is by showing that it's logical consequence is absurd or contradictory.

As an example, suppose we have an essay arguing for using less tools while building software. This is the author's *reduct ad absurdum* to help alleviate some stress in the reader:

> Taking this reasoning to its _reductio ad absurdum_ would mean picking Java, and then trying to implement a website without using anything else at all. And that would be crazy. You need some means to add things to your toolbox.

That's from [this essay](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) on choosing boring technology.
