# Dichotomy of control

This is a [[Stoic]] concept, made famous by [[Epictetus]] and the basic idea is that most things that happen in the world fall under two categories:

1. Things you can control
2. Things you can't control

The things you can control are most often your inner emotions, your response to circumstances, and how you treat people.

The things you can't control are everything else. But typically, we seem to switch the categories and try to control the events that happen to us and excuse our behaviors and reactions to things because "that's just how I am," or something like that.

Most feelings are rooted somewhere deep in the past, so I'm trying to say it's easy to not be fearful or scared of something. But the first step to conquering that is to walk down the path in the first place and understand, "Okay, I *do* have control over these things. It may not be easy, but I do. I don't have control over how my boss talks to me or how my parents talk about my career, so I have to do my best no not let those get to me and try and control my emotions and reactions."

Could use this as a fiction story... how could I write this?
