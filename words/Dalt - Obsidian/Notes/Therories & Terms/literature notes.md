Literature notes are notes taken from a book, podcast, video, essay, or something like that. Though they may be a bit more robust than [[fleeting notes]], they aren't exactly [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]] either.

They are typically a recreation of someone else's talk or idea. Therefore, can also be referred to as "Outline notes."

They don't have any original ideas, but are most likely a starting point for your own original ideas or [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]].
