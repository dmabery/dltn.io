# Yule's Law of Complementarity
- If two attributes or products are complements, the value/demand of one of the complements will be inversely related to the price of the other complement.
- If price of X decreases, it's complimentary product, Y's demand will increase. 

## Examples
- King Camp Gillette reduced the prize of razors and the demand for razor blades increased. Thanks to supply and demand, we know this will cause the price of razors to increase. Which it did.
- Printers did the same thing
- Electric toothbrushes are doing this same thing as well.

## Named after
I named this law after [George Udny Yule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udny_Yule) (1912), who was the statistician who proposed the [seminal equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule%E2%80%93Simon_distribution) for explaining the relationship between two attributes.
