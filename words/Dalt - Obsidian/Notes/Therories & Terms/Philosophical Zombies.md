Normally, in the classic thought experiment, a zombie is a human in a hypothetical but conceivable universe where physics is exactly the same as here; indeed, the state of the world is the same as well, and yet nothing is going on inside anyone’s head. It’s like you turned the lights off on the streams of consciousness all over Earth. There’s no feeling, no inner life, no experiences. There are still ions being exchanged through biomolecular pumps, there’s still the pop-pop of neuronal firing, there’s still the circulate motions of your meat mouth as you vibrate the air to talk, there’s still the dance of atoms down at the basement of the world—everything as it was, but everything different, for there is nothing it’s like to be anyone in a p-zombie universe. The argument is a thought pump meant to shift your intuitions toward finding dualism more conceivable. Is it not imaginable for minds to “go on in the dark” instead of being conscious? And if so, matter and mind must be fundamentally different—at least, that’s what the proposers of the thought experiment want you to think.
