**Berkeley's razor** is a rule of reasoning proposed by the philosopher [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Karl Popper") in his study of Berkeley's key scientific work _De Motu_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley#cite_note-Berkeley's_Philosophical_Writings_1974-10) Berkeley's razor is considered by Popper to be similar to [Ockham's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ockham%27s_razor "Ockham's razor") but "more powerful". It represents an extreme, [empiricist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") view of scientific observation **that states that the scientific method provides us with no true insight into the nature of the world. Rather, the scientific method gives us a variety of partial explanations about regularities that hold in the world and that are gained through experiment.** The nature of the world, according to Berkeley, is only approached through proper [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") speculation and reasoning.[[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley#cite_note-44)
