# The Law of Digitiplication
- Digitalization + multiplication
- _The law of digitiplication stipulates that whenever a resource or process is digitalized, its potential value grows in a multiplicative manner_.

> Consider the example of a retail store. The storeâ€™s sales reps, tasked with selling physical products to individual people, are able to service only one customer at a time. However, if the same retail environment is placed online, many customers can view the storeâ€™s products and services. Digital text can also easily be transformed into an audio format, providing a different kind of value to customers.
