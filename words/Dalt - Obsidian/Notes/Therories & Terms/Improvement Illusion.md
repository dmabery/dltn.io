# Improvement Illusion

- The false idea that if you postpone writing about an idea, you'll write about it better at a later date.



## Quotes
- The truth is you'll never find a better time to focus because the momentary epiphany is likely _the most focus you'll ever have_ on that particular idea. Your motivation to write about it will only decrease over time.
