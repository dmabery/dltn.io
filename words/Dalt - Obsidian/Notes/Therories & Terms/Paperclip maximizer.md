A [[Artificial general intelligence]] machine whose goal is to maximize the number of paperclips in its collection. It can collect paperclips, earn money to buy paperclips, and even build its own paperclip manufacturing machines.

It would work to improve its own intelligence, which would create more paperclips, which would improve its own intelligence and this cycle would repeat continually. It would increase its intelligence not because intelligence is good, but because intelligence leads to more paperclips. 

At some point, it might transform "first all of earth and then increasing portions of space into paperclip manufacturing facilities".

The danger in this, is with [[Instrumental Convergence]], where the paperclip maximizer recognizes you are made of atoms and atoms can be used to create more paperclips, which it very much likes to do. It also knows that by getting turned off, it can no longer create more paperclips.
