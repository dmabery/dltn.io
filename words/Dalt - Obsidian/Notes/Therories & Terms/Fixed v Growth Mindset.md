# Fixed v Growth Mindset
> For twenty years, my research has shown that _the view you adopt for yourself_ profoundly affects the way you lead your life. It can determine whether you become the person you want to be and whether you accomplish the things you value. How does this happen? How can a simple belief have the power to transform your psychology and, as a result, your life?

Believing that your qualities are carved in stone â€” _the fixed mindset_ â€” creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character â€” well, then youâ€™d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldnâ€™t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.

[â€¦]

Iâ€™ve seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves â€” in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: _Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser? . . ._

Thereâ€™s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand youâ€™re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when youâ€™re secretly worried itâ€™s a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand youâ€™re dealt is just the starting point for development. This _growth mindset_ is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way â€” in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments â€” everyone can change and grow through application and experience.

Do people with this mindset believe that anyone can be anything, that anyone with proper motivation or education can become Einstein or Beethoven? No, but they believe that a personâ€™s true potential is unknown (and unknowable); that itâ€™s impossible to foresee what can be accomplished with years of passion, toil, and training.
