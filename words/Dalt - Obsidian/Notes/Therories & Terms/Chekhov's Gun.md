# Chekhov's Gun

The term “Chekhov's gun” emerged from the ways Chekhov repeatedly characterized writing in letters to his contemporaries. The most famous version advises: “**If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired.** **Otherwise don't put it there.**”
