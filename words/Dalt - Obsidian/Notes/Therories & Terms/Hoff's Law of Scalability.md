# Hoff's Law of Scalability
- *The potential for scalability of a technology product is inversely proportional to its degree of customization and directly proportional to its degree of standardization.*
- In sum, the law predicts that a technology component or process that has a high degree of customization and/or a lower degree of standardization will be a poor candidate for scaling.

 > It was the quest to create a scalable product that led Intelâ€™s Ted Hoff to partition the chip into a general-purpose logic processor chip and a separate read-only memory (ROM) chip that stored an application program. As Albert Yu shows in his history of Intel, [_Creating the Digital Future_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Creating_the_Digital_Future.html?id=AYa1AAAAIAAJ)_,_ the fledgling semiconductor companyâ€™s general-purpose processor, the 4004, was scalable and pretty much bequeathed the world the hardware architecture of the modern computer. And it was Hoff who redesigned the 4004 to scale.


## Named After
This law is named after Marcian Edward (Ted) Hoff Jr.â€”the engineer who convinced the CEO of Intel to apply the law of scalability to the design and development of processors.
