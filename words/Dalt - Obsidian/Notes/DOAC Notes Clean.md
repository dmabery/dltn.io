- The goal of social posts should *not* be to direct people back to YouTube/podcast player. Instead, it should be to entertain, inspire, and inform people on the native platform so they become an engaged fan.
	- Action step: Figure out what topics perform the best on each channel. For them:
		- IG: Health (mental and physical), relationships, "bettering" yourself
		- LinkedIn: Career advice, work, productivity
	- Action step: What can we film before/after an interview as social-only content. This makes people who follow us feel like they're getting an inside look at the podcast.
	- Action step: What is our social strategy aside from podcast clips and quotes? What can we post to engage with followers that is separate from the interview.
- Clips, trailers, and Shorts are more than simply "here's a cool piece of information." There needs to be a hook that engages people (and sometimes this isn't the beginning of the video), and a story arc (beginning, middle, and end) to the point being discussed. This is all in positioning. A clip with great information will not be watched if that information isn't presented right.
