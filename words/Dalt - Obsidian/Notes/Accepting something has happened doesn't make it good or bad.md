# Accepting something has happened doesn't make it good or bad

My friends and I used to have a joke when one of us would mess up. We'd say, "Hey, that's okay. The first step to recovery is admittance."

But that simple little phrase is true. You can't work on something that you refuse to acknowledge.

Often, when something unwanted happens to someone, they ignore it as long as possible. They assume, wrongly, that if they never acknowledge it, it will disappear and turn into fairy dust.

Inevitably, they find out that isn't true and eventually comes a-knockin' on their door. Now, they're forced to deal with it in a rushed manner. They don't have time to think through different options. So they take the first thought they have and get it off their plate.

But this cycle continues. Eventually it will come a-knockin' again, forcing them to deal with it quickly to get rid of it, and so on.

So, what are we to do? Acknowledge it. Acknowledge there's a problem to be dealt with. Doing so doesn't *define* the problem as good or bad - it just sets you up to start thinking about it, before it comes knocking and demanding to be dealt with immediately.
