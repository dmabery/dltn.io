# Work should fill the gaps in our leisure schedule, not the other way around

We typically default to schedule everything we want to get done in a week and then fill in leisure time around that. But when we make that initial schedule, we're assuming we will have 40+ hours of non-stop productive work. But we all know that's not how it works.

Instead, things come up that take away from our initial focus. Sometimes these things are important and sometimes they're not. But they pull us away from our intended schedule. Now, we're forced to work more hours to get everything done. This is why people say they don't have time to read a book or exercise - they've over-scheduled it all away!

So what to do instead? Instead, schedule those leisure times and fit in work around them. It sounds easy, but it's much more difficult to do in practice. I'm sure it's not as hard as we actually think it is though.
