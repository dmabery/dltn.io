Something [[Stephan Ango]] said on the Thoroughly considered podcast made me realize that my entire coffee ritual has no motors.

Aside from the electric kettle, there is no other electricity involved, and I love that. It speaks to the craft of coffee making.

- I grind the beans by hand
- I use a digital scale (so there are batteries there)
- I use a vacuum seal container to keep the beans fresh
- And I use the metal V60 with white paper filters for the actual brew process

I also love it because it's easy to clean up. A french press makes a good cup, but a french press is messy to clean and you get grounds in the sink and it's just not fun.

Plus, there is more of an art and craft to the V60. With a french press, you can just pour the water in there and wait. With a V60, you have to think critically about what you're doing, and why.
