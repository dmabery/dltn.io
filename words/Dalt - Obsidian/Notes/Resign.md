Dear Shane,

Please accept this email as a notice of resignation from my position as the Senior Digital Creator and Designer at Farnam Street. My last day of full-time employment will be July 17, 2024.

It's not often an employee gets a chance to work for a company whose mission, philosophies, and ideas they believe in, but such was the case for my time working here. I've had a fantastic time helping others "master the best of what other people have already figured out," and am proud of where we grew the YouTube and social channels to.

I recognize the hardship my resignation brings to the small team, so I've arranged for all of my work to be covered.

Starting in July:

Marcel and his team can edit videosâ€”both in-person interviews and Zoom videos. Over the summer, I'll work with Marcel to ensure they know how to make the trailers. They will also make thumbnails and upload the videos to YouTube.

Nick and Catherine will still cover the audio version of the podcast and the transcripts, respectively.

I'm proposing to stay on as a part-time Producer while I attend school. I'll handle social scheduling, titling episodes and writing descriptions, posting new episodes and transcripts to the website, and sending member emails, just like I'm currently doing. I'll also continue managing Marcel, Nick, and Catherine. Ideally, this will ensure no one has to be hired or trained to do something new.

Thank you for the opportunity to work with Farnam Street. I've loved every minute of it.

Sincerely,
Dalton
