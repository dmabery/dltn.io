# Why you have to be careful about what conventional wisdom you believe.

-  Today, conventional wisdom in a rapidly changing world is not accurate and our brains can't compute with that, so wisdom doesn't accumulate like it used to. Therefore, conventional wisdom can't be trusted, but our brains don't have an "off-setting" to *not* trust it.
			- Some things aren't changing, like relationships and love. So conventional wisdom is accurate with that and has accumulated. Older people have great advice on relationships and love because they've lived through it all and got taught lessons when they were younger.
			- But older people don't have the best advice on picking a job, because the world has changed so much regarding jobs since they got their wisdom about finding a job.
