Tim,

We did a video call last year to chat about video and YouTube at GOLF. I loved the conversation, but I wasn't ready to make any changes at that time.

I'm not sure if you've hired anyone since then, but I'd love to revisit that idea.

[Here's a quick audit of GOLF's YouTube](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18W3lZPsEIrk8hJ3qY-8RJ13h9svFpE6Jp6gLhgKnqnU/edit?usp=sharing) that I put together with some things I've learned while growing a channel to 200k subscribers and more than tripling annual revenue. YouTube is much more than simply editing and posting videos. It's psychology and human nature; it's using words and graphics to get people to click, and I love that. Since YouTube follows a power law—the best 1% of content gets 99% of the views—thinking deliberately about titles, thumbnails, and intros, pays off.

I hope the crew is having a blast at The Players, I'm looking forward to all their content!

PS Here are some videos I’ve created:

[9 Mental Models to Help You Think Like a Genius](https://youtu.be/ocMH2l2ptpc?si=OptJ2jKgwiFtt6rb) - Wrote script, filmed and edited b-roll, and created all motion graphics and animations. Made thumbnail and title.

 [Don’t Make This Crucial Thinking Mistake](https://youtu.be/k_zt6qRTmN0?si=TBX_8VXgwAackevo) - Filmed and edited b-roll, created all motion graphics and animations. Made thumbnail and title.
 
[The Non-Verbal Expert…](https://youtu.be/YrMiKxPV_Ig?si=QqiT9qjonX8T6Jm0) - Edited interview and intro trailer. Made thumbnail and title.
