1. Don't eat sweets
2. Workout 6 days a week (do *something*)
	1. Run
	2. Life weights
3. Eat a lot of protein, a lot of vegetables (I'm not great at this), and some carbs
4. Have one cheat day a week, but don't move this around. Choose what you will eat. I love burgers and fries and pizza. Often, pizza is my cheat day choice, but I don't have it weekly because good pizza is expensive.
5. Limit your alcohol intake. Beer has *a lot* of carbs.
