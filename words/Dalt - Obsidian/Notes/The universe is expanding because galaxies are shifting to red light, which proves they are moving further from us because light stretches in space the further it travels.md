They know that the universe is expanding because galaxies that we could once see, we can't anymore. Their light had stretched from the visible light part of the spectrum to red light. This happens when light travels a further distance in space, it stretches.  This is why we can't see galaxies far away because their light has traveled so far that it's invisible.

So the only plausible explanation is that the galaxies we could once see, are moving away from us and their light is now traveling too far for us to see it.
