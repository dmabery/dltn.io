# Evan's Law of Modularity
- _The inflexibilities, incompatibilities, and rigidities of complex and/or monolithically structured technologies could be simplified by the modularization of the technology structures (and processes)_.
- This law predicts that the application of modularization will reduce incompatibilities and complexities.
