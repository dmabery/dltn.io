People read stories of someone committing fraud or having a moral failure and think, "I'd never make that decision."

And they're probably right; they never would. The problem is, the person committing the mistake didn't make that decision either.

People don't wake up one morning and say, "I'm going to ruin my marriage today." Or, "I'm going to defraud my investors this afternoon."

(Okay, *most* people don't.)

Instead, they make one decision that, on its own, might be questionable, but not illegal or immoral.

And then they make another one...

And another one...

And another one...

And when they look back on all their decisions, they realized they committed fraud or ruined their marriage.

Garrett Graff in *Watergate* writes:

> “Labeling [Watergate] a ‘criminal conspiracy’ implies a level of forethought, planning, and precise execution that isn’t actually evident at any stage of the debacle. Instead, the key players slipped, fumbled, and stumbled their way from the White House to prison, often **without ever seeming to make a conscious decision to join the cover-up**.”

Most gigantic mistakes are a series of slips, fumbles, and stumbles.

That decision that toes the line of morality might lead you down a slippery slope. **If you have to convince yourself it's right, it's probably not.**
