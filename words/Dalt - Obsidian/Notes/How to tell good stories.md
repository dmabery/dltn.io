Talented storytellers know something bad storytellers don't: storytelling is **the art of strategically withholding information.** Before you begin your story, you're supposed to decide which details to **withhold** until the end—to maximize suspense along the way.

You never want to memorize your words. You only memorize key points then you rediscover the rich details and spontaneous turns of phrases in real time. This produces pauses, moments of self-reflection, and false starts.

**In other words, storytelling is not only the art of strategically withholding information, it’s also the art of time dilation.**
