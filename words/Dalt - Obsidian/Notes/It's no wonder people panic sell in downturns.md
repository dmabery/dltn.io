# It's no wonder people panic sell in downturns

In Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel makes a great point about *saying* what you'll do in the middle of a downturn and actually *doing* that thing. He mentions that most of the time when the stock market takes a massive dip, something terrible happened that caused the crash. So, it's not as if everything in the world is going smooth and the stock market just took a dip, but that there was a terrorist attack that happened. So now your forced to manage your money and navigate a crisis situation. Doing this well is much harder.

He also mentions the grit and determination it takes to buy stock through a downturn. It makes sense looking back, but again, it's much harder to do in the moment.

And it's that one I have always been confused by. This is my first "economic downturn" where I'm actually paying attention to the markets and have stuff riding on some companies and I'm absolutely mind-blown by the panic in the streets. Every other article is touting the doom is this company or that company and every fifth post on Twitter is of sharp negative hockey sticks. Theses aren't the most comforting things to see when you told yourself you'll buy when it's low. It also makes sense now why people panic sell. Heck, I've got very little in the stock market and I'm a bit nervous!

I don't get it. I truly don't. I'm not sure *exactly* what caused the markets to crash, because I'm pretty sure it was a Lollapalooza Effect of many things from the past few years finally crashing into each other, but why is everyone freaking out?

Has the market ever not recovered from a crash on a long-term horizon? I understand the emotional effects of seeing your retirement or big nest egg wiped out, but people have got to understand that it's not going to just keep going down, right?
