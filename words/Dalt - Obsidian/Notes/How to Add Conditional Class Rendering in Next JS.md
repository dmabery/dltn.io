# How to Add Conditional Class Rendering in Next JS

```javascript
const condition = image ? 'flex flex-row items-center' : 'flex-none sm:flex flex-row items-center'

return (

<div className={condition}>
```

In this example, I wanted to display a prop in two different ways. One way if there was an image and a different way if there was no image.

So I used a ternary operator with the prop I wanted to check, `image`, and if that was true rendered one class list and if it was false then I rendered another.

Can even clean it up and not DRY by doing this:

```javascript

const PageTitle = ({title, description, image}) => {

const condition = image ? 'flex' : 'flex-none sm:flex'

return (

<div className={`flex-row items-center ${condition}`}>

```

Conditional class rendering is pretty simple, but I've had to think through it a few times and always forget how to do it immediately. Hopefully this helps me and will help you too.

Note: I'm using Tailwind for my CSS, but if you're using custom CSS, the idea is the same, the classes will just be different.

In this example, I'm trying to render different classes based on whether or not there is an `image` prop passed to my `PageTitle` component. I'm using this to display the title and description on my site, but on the home page I have a .gif that I don't want on any other pages. So on the home page, I'm passing an `image` prop and on the other pages I'm not. I have conditional rendering statement adding a div as a child to flexbox if there is an image prop.

The issue I was trying to solve was my mobile display of the `PageTitle` component. If there was an image, then the text covered 2/3 of the screen and the image was next to it. All good there. But if there wasn't an image, the text still covered 2/3 of the screen and created an awkward empty space. So on mobile, if there was no `image` prop, I wanted to take the `flex` property off the container but put it back for larger breakpoints because I didn't want to description text to span the entire page container. So here's what I did.

First, create a variable with a ternary operator to check whatever you want to check. In this case, if `image` was true, I wanted to add `flex` class. If `image` was `false`, I wanted to add `flex-none` and `sm:flex` breakpoint. `sm-flex` says "On break points larger than small, do this." `flex-none` is the behavior of all other breakpoints. In this case, just the `xs` breakpoint.

```javascript

const PageTitle = ({title, description, image}) => {

const condition = image ? 'flex' : 'flex-none sm:flex'

```

Next, I added that ternary operator as a string template literal to my classes on the container rendering the component:

```javascript

const PageTitle = ({title, description, image}) => {

const condition = image ? 'flex' : 'flex-none sm:flex'

return (
	<div className={`flex-row items-center ${condition}`}>


```

So if image is `true`, the `flex` container will be added as a `className` and the component will flex naturally. If it's false, on breakpoints smaller than `small`, it will be a normal, full-length row.

Note: If you don't have any classes there in both instances, you can just add the variable to the `className` and don't have to do a string template literal.
