# Why I use a legal pad for most notes and tasks
There's something lovely about using a legal pad for work. Maybe because it plays into my desire of being a 20th century writer, or maybe it's because I stare at a computer all day that I'm finally happy to be using something that doesn't have pixels on the other side.

But yes, on my desk, next to my keyboard and usually in-between my cup of coffee, I have a white legal pad that I use to keep track of my tasks and jot down any [[fleeting notes]].

Every night, I write the next day's date on the next open space followed by some to-dos that I need to work on the next day. They are typically pretty specific, such as "Edit the podcast and upload to YouTube",  but other times they are less so.

Sometimes I write, "Think about this idea I heard on TV tonight", an example of a [[fleeting notes]]. Then, I give myself the opportunity to write that in my #writing-inbox and flesh that idea out at some later date, probably turning it into an [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]].

For some reason, I also only use sharpie on this legal pad. I don't know where that idea came from, but it's stuck and I've been doing it for years now.

Whenever I finish a legal pad, I write the timeline that it covers, for example one might say "November 2020 - March 2021." That way I have a log or journal to look through when I want to reflect or do my [[Annual review]].
