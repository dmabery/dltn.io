- Boundaries cannot be something that's reliant on somebody else. If you ask your kid, "Hey, turn that off after fifteen minutes," that is entirely dependent upon them listening to you. That's not a boundary; that's a request. A boundary is saying, "Hey, after fifteen minutes, I'm gonna come in there – and I really don't want to do this – and I'm going to turn it off." With that, you are entirely in control of the outcome.
