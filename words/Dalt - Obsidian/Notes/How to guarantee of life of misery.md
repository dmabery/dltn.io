Johnny Carson gave a speech on a similar topic. His prescription for guaranteeing a life of misery was:

1) Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception;
2) Envy; and
3.  Resentment.

Charlie Munger [added four more](https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/how-to-guarantee-a-life-of-misery-by-charlie-munger):

1. "First, be unreliable."

2. "My second prescription for misery is to learn everything you possibly can from your own personal experience, minimizing what you learn vicariously from the good and bad experience of others, living and dead."

3. "My third prescription for misery is to go down and stay down when you get your first, second, third severe reverse in the battle of life."

4. "My final prescription to you for a life of fuzzy thinking and infelicity is to ignore a story they told me when I was very young about a rustic who said: “I wish I knew where I was going to die, and then I’d never go there.”

I want to add nine more:

1. Watch TV every day after work while eating fast food. Wake up right before you have to leave for work and repeat.

1. Love no one.

2. Don't take risks.

3. Don't ever leave your hometown.

4. Don't spend money on anything you don't need. No fun, no gadgets, nothing. Save ruthlessly.

5. Don't give anyone anything without asking for something in return.

6. Default to trusting no one.
7. ABFY: Always Be Fooling Yourself. If you can get yourself to believe lies about the effectiveness of using a supplement, adopting a worldview, buying a stock that's 'only going to go up,' or some other panacea, you'll be the most miserable person on earth. In fact, if you want to be miserable, this is *all* you have to do. It's effective because there is no one else to blame, so you're miserable twice over. Once because you believed the lie, and again because you're the one who told it to yourself! At least when someone else fools you, you can blame them, and only be mad at yourself for falling prey to their deceptive con.
