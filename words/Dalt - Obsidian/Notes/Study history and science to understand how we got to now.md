# Study history and science to understand how we got to now

Similar to the book by Steven Johnson, [[10 Pending/21 Readwise/Readwise/Books/How We Got to Now]], I'm obsessed with studying history and science to understand how the world got to where it is today.

After reading [[Einstein - His Life and Universe]] and trying to understand Relativity and now reading [[Edison]], there's just so much out there that shapes how we live today. It's so cool when I learn something that explains why something is the way it is today and I want to learn all the facts!

It's one of the reasons I wanted to read [[The Story of Civilization]] by Will and Ariel Durant. It's the most comprehensive volume on the history of civilization.

I want to read [[Thing Explainer]] and [[What If]] by [[Randall Munroe]] to get a deeper understanding of these things. There are many [[People and Things I'm Inspired By]].
