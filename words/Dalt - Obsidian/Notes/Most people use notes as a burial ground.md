# Most people use notes as a burial ground
When people, especially knowledge workers, don't want to forget an idea or a topic, or a question, they will usually write said idea, topic, or question down somewhere in Notion or maybe a scratchpad ([[Why I use a legal pad for most notes and tasks]]).

But then those notes never live to see the light of day and live a sad, miserable life trying to resurface themselves to become [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]].

But that rarely happens. Writing down the note somewhere makes someone feel good. It makes them feel like they have their life in order and that they're learning something new. But the real work of developing an idea comes *outside of the note*.
