I wonder if this is also a result of the algorithmic world we live in.

I keep coming back to authors who published massive volumes of biographies/histories (Durant, Caro, Churchill, Gibbons) that took years in between each edition.

To me, that seems like such a feat because they battled the "man, another year of unproductive work because I didn't 'publish' anything."

But I don't think that thought ever crossed their minds. They were content with chipping away at their projects year after year with nothing to show for it.

In today's world, that's unheard of.
