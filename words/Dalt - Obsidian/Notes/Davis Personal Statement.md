#law-school 
March 2, 2023, could've been the last time I saw my wife.

It wasn't the most romantic of scenes, and from the outside probably looked like something out of *Grey's Anatomy* with the fluorescent lights, her hospital gown three sizes too big, and the oxygen flowing past her ears and into her nose. We hugged goodbye; the transport official rolled her through the double doors; I looked at my mom, and wept.

That moment was almost a year ago, and the events that followed upended, altered, and changed both of our lives. It gave my wife a new lease on life, and it gave me a new meaning to mine.

My wife was born with pulmonary fibrosis, a genetic condition that causes scarring in the lungs and causes their functionality to be rendered useless. There is no cure. Once the lungs diminish beyond a certain capacity, a double-lung transplant is the only thing that allows a person to live.

I met my wife in August 2017. We both committed to a two-year long internship at Bayside Church, and as fate would have it, I moved in right down the street from her. When we first started dating a year later, I knew something was different about her. Her father, I knew, passed away from an illness when she was in high school, but she waited a while to tell me she was diagnosed with the same thing. She made it clear that life would not be "normal" for what most healthy twenty-year olds experience, and that it was okay if I wanted to end things. I appreciated her candidness, but for some reason, I knew I was meant to be with her.

~~In my vows to her at our wedding, I recounted an idea I'd heard of bravery. For people fighting during World War Two, the public and newspapers called them brave, but for the actual soldiers, what looked like bravery to other people was, for them, just the logical next step. I knew when I met my wife, despite the challenged from others that life would be difficult, hard, and not at all what I'd imagined it would be, spending the rest of our lives together, to me, was the logical next step.~~

From the time we got married, her health diminished rapidly. She started using oxygen full-time, had trouble going up and down our stairs, and eventually had to quit working. She used a feeding tube every night because of how much weight she was losing, and could only be out of the house for a few hours at a time before she became too tired. I had to leave my job at the church to find something more flexible, so I could honor our vows and be her caretaker, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.

We waited two years for the phone call that would bring the lung transplant, and knew it would be sudden. I was on my way out to buy *The Trials of Harry S. Truman* (a book that would've come in handy during the next few months), when I received a phone call from a Palo Alto area code. On the other end were words that changed our lives: "Hello this AJ. I'm part of the lung transplant team at Stanford and we have a lung for Kendal. Can you guys be here soon?"

While my wife's life was physically changed forever that day, the following months changed me in unimaginable ways. Watching the doctors and nurses – people who have studied, learned, and worked hard – do what they love while taking care of my wife forced me to examine *my* life. "Am I doing what I want to be doing?" I kept asking myself.

I realized that answer was a resounding "No." I love video editing and designing things, but while taking care of my wife, I realized I want to help other people the same way those doctors and nurses helped my wife, not figure out the most effective ways to capture someone's attention on social media or sell them an online course they'll probably never watch.

While my wife was going through the recovery process, whenever I had a moment to myself, I was absorbed in a book. I've also loved to read, but now, with life changing so suddenly, I found books allowed me to escape into a world that I could control. I read numerous biographies about John F. Kennedy, Alexander Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln, The Wright Brothers, and other innovators. I read books about famous historical events like Watergate and the corrupt Justice Department in the 1920s during the Teapot Dome Scandal. But a book that had the most profound impact on my career change was a biography of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Learning about how he shaped the Supreme Court through his unique writing style, and his philosophy on the 14th Amendment, combined with his general love of learning and reading, opened my eyes to the path of law.

My wife's health problems are not over. In a way, a new one has only just begun. But as I've lived through this experience, I've learned everyone has their own "sickness" to battle. Whether it's an injustice they've faced from a company, a serious crime inflicted upon them by an assailant, or a difficult circumstance with loved ones, problems in life will never end. What I hope to learn during law school – and apply to life afterward – will ensure that I can be there for people just like the doctors were for my wife. I may not be able to inject an IV, but I know with a respectful ear, a full understanding of the problem, and sound knowledge of the law, I can help someone right the wrong they're facing.


[[Good example of personal statement]]


### What to include
- I have to talk about why I want to be a lawyer. How did a design major who got a C in the only law class he took in undergrad decide he wants to practice law?
- Don't act like you're running away from something. Show the admissions committee what you're running toward in going to law school.
- The big question is always: what did you learn about yourself?
- You have to add the event, emotions, and lessons, not just one or two
	- What happened
	- How did it make you feel
	- What did you learn
