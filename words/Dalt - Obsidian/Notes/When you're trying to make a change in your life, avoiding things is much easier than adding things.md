If you're trying to get healthy, it takes less will-power to say no to sweets and junk food than it does to workout every day.

If you're trying to be more thoughtful, and less ruled by hot takes, it's much easier to avoid news and current events on television, than it is to start reading books (if you're not already a reader).
