Hey Shannon! It was great to see you last week. Hope you and the family made it home safely and are ready for what the new year has in store!

I wanted to ask a favor. I'm applying to law schools for August 2024 admissions, and wanted to see if you'd have the capacity to, and be willing to, write a letter of recommendation on my behalf. Most schools encourage academic references, not professional ones; I thought you would be a great candidate. In your role for Thrive/SEU, you were in a unique position to evaluate my academic performance, as well as how I handled day-to-day responsibilities as a Thrive student. Being able to balance the differing aspects of the program, along with my academic responsibilities, is what I was hoping you'd be able to discuss.

There's absolutely no pressure. I know you have your hands full with everything going on, but let me know! If you have any questions, we can also do a phone call. I'd love to explain some of the factors that lead to this decision.

Hey man! It was great to see you last night. Thanks so much for the delicious dinner and book conversation. 

I wanted to ask a favor. I'm applying to law school for August 2024, and wanted to see if you'd have the capacity to, and be willing to, write a letter of recommendation on my behalf. Most schools encourage academic references, not professional ones; I thought you would be a great candidate. In your role for Thrive and as an SEU professor, you were in a unique position to evaluate my academic performance, as well as how I handled day-to-day responsibilities as a Thrive student. Being able to balance the differing aspects of the program, along with my academic responsibilities, is what I was hoping you'd be able to discuss, along with an insight into my desire to learn and read.

There's absolutely no pressure. I know you have your hands full with everything going on, but let me know! If you have any questions, we can also do a phone call or a coffee.
