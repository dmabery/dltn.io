Shane,

#work 

Now that we have the video/audio side of the podcast taken care of with Marcel, I wanted to re-visit the conversation about me staying on part-time during school to 1) handle the administrative side of the podcast for the site, titles, descriptions, and members emails, and run social and 2) be a liaison between Marcel, his team and you for simple questions and to ensure brand-quality.

Ideally, this helps us both out: no one else has to be hired and trained, and you don't have to be more involved than you already are with podcast operations so you can keep working on the most important things.

I'm editing TKP 196 (06/11) and 197 (06/25). I'm thinking Marcel and his team will start at 198 (07/09), skip 199 (07/23), and move on to 200 (08/06) when it's recorded. 199 is the Esther Perel re-release, and I'll edit that. They are starting at 198 because it's a Zoom video, and I want to make sure they get experience with that before I leave.

My last check is currently for June 19. I'd like to stay on until July 17 so I can keep editing videos, but I understand if you'd like me to transition out of full time sooner now that Marcel is on board.

PS I've got about 100 episodes swapped in Spotify. I should be able to finish by the end of next week, barring any major technical difficulties uploading/downloading.
