# Working with the garage door up

When I was little, I always loved having the garage door open because you never knew who was going to walk by. Sometimes it was the neighbors who always supported my school fundraisers and other times it was someone who I've never met before!

That's the cool thing about working with the garage door open, **you never know who you're going to meet!** This is why I publish my notes, write, tweet, and make TikToks. It's why I do anything online. Similar to Matthew Kobach's idea of [[Being a lighthouse for likeminded people]], working with the garage door open increase your encounters with people who think like you do (in a good way). You never know what opportunities might change your life from someone who read your blog online :)
