# It's easy to learn programming languages the more languages you learn

Your brain doesn't file information in neat rows and cabinets. Instead, it strings together ideas and material based on the ideas and material it already knows.

So when you learn JavaScript, it doesn't get filed under a 'JavaScript' filing cabinet in the 'Programming' or 'Computer' aisle. It gets lumped somewhere by HTML and CSS. But now that you have all this JavaScript information in your brain, learning React, Rails, or any other programming language is pretty easy. Because it can associate that new material to all of the JS material. As that library grows, it gets easier and easier to learn a language.

That's why devs can learn a language or a framework only by looking at docs once they've mastered or semi-mastered JavaScript.
