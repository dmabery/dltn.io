# Discipline will only take you so far
- The most successful people aren't more disciplined. They're more consistent. They do the things that they're great at, even when they don't feel like it.
 
## How can you create that consistency?
By creating a ritual and following it no matter how you feel. If you have a ritual, you're not relying on motivation to do anything. Because, in the end, [[Motivation is a myth]] You're now relying on the ritual.

> What looks like skill is often just consistency. Consistency creates talent. And you won't be consistent if you only do things when you feel like doing them.
