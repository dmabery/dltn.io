# Why time slows down when you go faster

Time slows down because momentum bends spacetime, causing time to pass slower.

Time is the fourth dimension of spacetime. Spacetime itself is curved by energy (gravity). Energy is mass, momentum, and light. The more energy there is (increased momentum, which increases mass), the more curved spacetime becomes. Resulting in time passing slower.

> Imagine that you have a very special clock. It consists of two mirrors facing each other, and a beam of light entrapped in the middle of the apparatus. The ray of light would naturally bounce between the two mirrors at a constant pace. Each time that it bounces, that can be considered as one tick. This tick will be now used as a standard of measurement. For example, if your mirrors are 30 cm apart, then you know that it would takeÂ 200 thousand million ticks for an egg to get boiled.

> Trevor really likes this clock and decides to steal it from you and escape inÂ his spaceship. He chooses to commit this crime in completeÂ darkness. It is so dark that when you follow the movement of the spaceship as it flies away, you can see nothing but the beam of light moving within the clock. Before the ship takes off, the light ray appears to be bouncing back and forth in a vertical axis.

> Now, Trevorâ€™s ship starts accelerating. To you, the beam, which was bouncing at the same spot before, now begins to move in a zigzag path. **The faster he moves, the longer the length of one tick seems.** 
> 
> Remember that the vertical distance of the light ray remains the same, but the horizontal distance increases with the speed.

> Now,Â with the longer distance, does that mean that the faster Trevorâ€™s ship moves, the faster the beam of light also becomes? But thatâ€™s impossible, right? The speed of light is always constant!
> 
> That leaves us with only one conclusion. If the beam of light has to go farther than before and it cannot speed up, that means that it must take longer for it to complete a tick.
> 
> In other words, the clock slows down.
> 
> Not just the clock, mind you. **Everything in the ship must slow down.**Â Even the minds of the people in the vehicle would have to reduce their movement through time!

That was probably the most simple explanation and understanding I've gotten... but it still doesn't really answer the question. That explains how it happens in a new way, but not why. I think it's because the example uses is a ray of light, and not just a regular clock. Maybe I'm looking for something that doesn't exist.

Note: I'm aware that an actual clock can't travel faster than the speed of light, and I think that's part of the equation but I can't seem to reconcile it.
