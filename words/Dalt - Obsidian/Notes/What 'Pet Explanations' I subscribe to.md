# What 'Pet Explanations' I subscribe to
[[Pet Explanations]] - simple ways of seeing the world and attributing causes to them (as at least how I think about them).

When I think about the pet explanations I subscribe to, I think of...
- Allowing myself/making an excuse that because I'm hungry, it's okay to be short or rude with people.
	- This same attitude goes for if I'm tired - often late at night when I'd rather be asleep or at home reading. I excuse this by telling myself I'm an introvert and my social battery has run out.
- I don't like to show people that I'm having too much fun at something because I don't want to be a burden.
- I lack confidence when it comes to asking for things.
	- Idk where this comes from, but I'm terrified to ask for my chips from chipotle when they aren't in the bag, even though I've paid for them. I hate being an inconvenience.
