# You can timetravel by leapfrogging into the future
Similar to the [[twin paradox]], say two people are the same age, Sandy and Earl.

Sandy boards a spaceship and travels 186,000 miles per second and zoom off into a star in our galactic neighborhood and come back. To Stella, the trip only takes a few days. But when Stella comes back, Earl is 20 years older! The paper is 20 years into the future from when Stella left, but it had only been a few days for her. Boom, Stella just time traveled.

We think this might work because [[Clocks sent around the world on a plane time travel]] too.
