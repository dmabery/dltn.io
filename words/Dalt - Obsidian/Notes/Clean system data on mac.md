As i know there are several ways to clear system data on Mac OS.

1: Clear system cache: Go to Finder > Go > Go to Folder, then type in "~/Library/Caches" and hit enter. Select all the folders inside the Caches folder and delete them.

2: Clear system logs: Go to Finder > Go > Go to Folder, then type in "/var/log" and hit enter. Select all the files inside the Log folder and delete them.

3: Remove unused language files: Go to Finder > Go > Go to Folder, then type in "/Library/Languages" and hit enter. Delete all the language folders you don't need.

4: Uninstall unused apps: Go to the Applications folder and delete the apps you don't use.

5: Clean up system files: Use a system cleaning tool like CleanMyMac X to scan and remove unnecessary system files.
