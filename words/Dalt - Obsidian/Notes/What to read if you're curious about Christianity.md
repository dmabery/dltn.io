There are two books I recommend to people struggling with questions of faith: *The Problem of God* and *The Problem of Jesus*, both by Mark Clark.

The former is a rigorously studied and logic-filled exploration of some of Christianity's toughest questions: "Why would a good God send people to hell?" Or, "Why is there so much evil and suffering in the world?" The latter applies the same level of rigour and logic to answering questions about Jesus, the Gospels, and discipleship. Both are truly a skeptic's guide to "challenges of Christianity."

A phenomenal essay for someone who believes in God, but is struggling with sin and love in their heart is "[The Expulsive Power of a New Affection](https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/Chalmers,%20Thomas%20-%20The%20Exlpulsive%20Power%20of%20a%20New%20Af.pdf)" by Thomas Chalmers. I read it every quarter and it's a great reminder that problems of sin are often problems of loving God and knowing him more.

For Christians who believe in God yet feel like they're missing something about his character or person or love, I recommend reading *Knowing God* by J.I. Packer. This book is not for the faint of heart, and is very heady. But the level of depth you'll be able to see God through after reading this book and ingesting its ideas is ten-fold where you are now.
