This happened to General Grant too.

After he was diagnosed with cancer and the doctor told him to stop, he simply...stopped. It was that easy.

This happened on Brooklyn 99. Holt was playing a game on his phone that he became hopelessly addicted to. That is, until he found out Scully also plays the game, and Scully is a bumbling idiot. That brief association snapped Holt out of his trance and he quit playing.

When the consequences of doing something outweighs the joys of doing that thing, behavior immediately changes.

Ulysses S. Grant smoked at least ten cigars a day for most of his life. When, at sixty, he was diagnosed with throat cancer and the pain of the cigar smoke in his mouth physically became too much to bear, he instantly quit. The joy of smoking a cigar was no longer worth the pain of smoking a cigar.

This happened on Brooklyn Nine-Nine too. In one episode, the straight-laced, no nonsense Captain Holt became addicted to Cwazy Cupcakes. He stopped paying attention to the important things at work and his assistant, Gina, tried everything she could to get him to quit, but nothing worked.

He instantly quit playing though, when he found out a detective who could rightly be categorized as a bumbling buffoon, Hitchcock, plays Cwazy Cupcakes. The pain of being associated with something Hitchcock did outweighed the joys of playing the game.

Someone on Twitter, [replying](https://x.com/RebeccaSlatkin/status/1765048172777189873?s=20) to a Tweet about hangovers and long-COVID, said, "Weird how a couple years ago I decided in the moment that ordering a drink at dinner wasn't worth the headache the next day and then I simply...stopped drinking?"

Theodore Roosevelt experienced this same phenomenon. David McCullough writes in *Mornings on Horseback*:

> [Roosevelt] suffered so from a hangover the morning after the Porcellian rites...that he drank but sparingly, if at all, from then on.

When the pain outweighs the joy, bad habits are easy to break.
