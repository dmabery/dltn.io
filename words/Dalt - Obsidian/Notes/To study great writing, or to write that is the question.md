I see these breakdowns a lot and can’t help but think…Seinfeld just knows how to write well. He’s not thinking, “Oh man I’m going to set up this tension and then break it and then set it up again.” He’s thinking, “This is funny and good. Let’s write it.” I guess that’s how we learn, by studying the greats, but I don’t think we can study something too in-depth that isn’t deliberate by the author.
