So you want to go to law school?

So did I! In fact, from a completely different field without having any experience or close family members in the legal field.

Here are some things you'll need to know.

## 1. The LSAT

You've heard it joked about on TV, but probably never really looked into what it is. Naturally, people think the LSAT tests your knowledge of the law. It does not. In fact, the LSAT doesn't have a single law related question on it. The LSAT measures your ability to *think*. That might sound intimidating, but I promise it's not because every section of the LSAT can be learned, yet some sections better than others.

Traditionally, the LSAT has three unique sections:

1. The Analytical Reasoning section (offered referred to as Logic Games or abbreviated as LG)
2. The Logical Reasoning section (abbreviated as LR)
3. The Reading Comprehension section (abbreviated as RC)

However, as of August 2024, the LSAT will only have Logical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension sections. Logic Games are being removed, thanks, ironically, to a lawsuit.

Some are happy about that happening because Logic Games are the most difficult part of the exam for some. While that's true for a lot of people, Logic Games is often considered the easiest section to learn and get better at because it's all diagramming and pattern recognition. When I was studying for the LSAT, I was taught that on Logic Games, I'm only as good as my diagramming.

Though there are only two types of sections on the LSAT, you will probably have four sections total: two scored sections of Logical Reasoning, one scored section of Reading Comprehension, and one unscored section of either Logical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension. The unscored section is used by the makers of the LSAT to test future questions. Though it's not scored, you won't know which sections are scored and which aren't. You can sometimes guess based on the question types, but for the most part, you should do your best on every section.

Each section measures your ability to think in slightly different ways. All the Logical Reasoning section cares about is how well you can identify the flaw in arguments and be able to translate that flaw into the correct answer. There are different variations of questions that I won't get into here, but that is the essence of Logical Reasoning questions.

Reading Comprehension measures your ability to read short, dense texts with often complicated ideas and identify the author's arguments, main points, conclusions, and so on.

You have thirty-five minutes to complete each section. If you finish before the time runs out, you can't move on to another section.

The best training resources I found where the LSAT Trainer. I recommend starting with this to get a bird's eye view of the LSAT, what the test is looking for, and strategies for solving every question type. I didn't do every practice section in this book, but I did most of them. After the first few chapters, he recommends taking a practice test. You can sign up for a free account on LSAC for a limited number of tests, or pay for the entire bank. The money is well worth it considering what you're getting out of it: every LSAT ever given.

After you finish that, move straight to Drilling and taking Practice Tests. Drilling refers to the act of doing the same types of questions over and over again. Not just Logical Reasoning or Reading Comprehension questions in general, though,
