The best curators of content do most, if not all, of the work for the reader. Ideally, the reader shouldn't have to go to the source material to understand the idea better or piece it together. That's your job as the curator. You have to provide the context and add examples that aren't there, to provide the most useful information for the person reading the content.

Basic curators just send ten links and say, "Good luck." But you've got to do more than that.

They also connect ideas from disparate disciplines in a way that no one else possibly could.
