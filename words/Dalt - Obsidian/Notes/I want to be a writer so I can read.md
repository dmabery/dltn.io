"I never had any desire to be a writer. I wanted to be a reader." – Adam Phillips

Austin Kleon writes, "I often tell people I became a professional writer so I could be a professional reader...What I really, really love is reading books. 

He continues:

> In my work, [problems of output are problems of input](https://austinkleon.com/2015/11/12/problems-of-output-are-problems-of-input/). If my work sucks, it’s usually because I’m not being a good enough fan. I need to read, and read voraciously, searching for that thing that’s going to get me back on track. Read books, write books, repeat. That’s the deal.
