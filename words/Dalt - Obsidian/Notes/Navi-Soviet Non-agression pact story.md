On blah, one man from the Soviet Union, smart enough to interpret the menacing signs of their border neighbors—and with actual power to do something about it—approached the British and French government with an idea: a triple alliance.

But two men, despising the Bolsheviks, were determined not to see it through. While they dragged their feet, the Nazi government tiptoed into Moscow and left with their own sort of alliance, a non-agression pact.

This is that story.

It's full of suspicion, personal vendettas, and many stops along the way where, had statesmen acted in accord with the protection of their country, a second world war may have been averted.
