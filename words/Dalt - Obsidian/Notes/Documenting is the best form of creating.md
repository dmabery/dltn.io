# Documenting is the best form of creating

From [[Matt D'Avella]]:

> Your competitors canâ€™t copy paste your brain. Nobody else has lived your life, and nobody else can replicate that mishmash of life experiences and idiosyncrasies that shape your unique perspective of the world.   
  
> So, if you truly want to exist in aÂ category of one, stop trying to â€˜createâ€™ and instead, **document the inner workings of that weird, wonderful brain of yours.** #quotes 

I love that. Documenting the weird, inner workings of my wonderful brain.
