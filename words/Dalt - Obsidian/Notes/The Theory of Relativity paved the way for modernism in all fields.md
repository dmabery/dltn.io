# The Theory of Relativity paved the way for modernism in all fields
Falsely assuming relativity is the same as relativism, people though relativity broke the ground for all sorts for field.

That was not the case. Instead, it just encouraged others to think in a modern way about art, science, philosophy, etc. It was purely intellectual, not political.
