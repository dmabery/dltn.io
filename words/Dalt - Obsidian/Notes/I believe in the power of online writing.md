I believe deeply in the power of writing. I believe deeply in the power of writing online.

Writing forces you to clarify your thinking and sheds light on questions, beliefs, and ideas that you thought you knew but really didn't.

In today's age, starting a blog is easier than ever. You can use Substack or WordPress or Blogger or MicroBlog or any of the other 1,000 blogging platforms available. The problem with those is that they aren't *yours.* Yeah, you can write custom CSS to change the style of the site on a lot of blogging platforms, but they're not unique. Every single person's Substack looks exactly the same.

And what happens if they just...disappear? What happens to all of your writing and ideas? Where do they go?

So, I created a simple blogging template you can use. It's chock-full of instructions for how to set it up if you've never done something like this before, and it's written in NextJS, so if you know a bit of code, you can customize it.

The posts are sourced from markdown files that live on your computer. There is no CMS and no middle man. I use Obsidian to write my posts, and I explain how to do that below, but you can use any text editor.
