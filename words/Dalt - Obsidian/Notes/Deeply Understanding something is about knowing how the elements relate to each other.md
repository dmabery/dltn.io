# Deeply Understanding something is about knowing how the elements relate to each other
Anyone can know a lot *about* something. That simply takes time to research and some time to reflect. But just because you know about something doesn't mean you know how something works.

For example, as I'm continuing on my journey learning to become a developer, I feel like I know a lot about JavaScript, React, and some other languages and frameworks. I have a decent amount of confidence that I can build something simple, it just might take me a bit longer than someone who is more experienced.

But where I usually get stuck is when I run into an error I don't know how to reconcile. Sometimes the error is precise, but other time's it is very vagueâ€“like my wife's answer when I ask what's bothering her.

This is where the "[[Gap of Knowledge]]" between a junior developer and a senior developer are more evident. A senior developer understands how each piece of technology is talking to the other and communicating, and knows where to look when something goes wrong. But as someone who is less familiar, a lot of the things work because "they just do," (which is never the answer) so I'm a bit more stuck when it comes to solving the solution.

Similarly, this is the difference between someone who knows *about* something and someone who *knows the something*. The latter isn't fooled when something goes wrong, because they can diagnose the issue.

A sure sign someone knows a lot *about* something and not the actual something is if they use a lot of jargon and big words to explain what they're thinking.
