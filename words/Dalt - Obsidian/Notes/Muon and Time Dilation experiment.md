# Muon and Time Dilation experiment
Scientists know when muons self destruct. They are radioactive particles.

If relativity is correct, a lot of the muons should reach the bottom of sea level because they're moving so fast, 0.9c.

If relativity isn't correct, their time passes the same that earth time passes and a lot of them should self-destruct.

The experiment proves that relativity is accurate and that most of the muons make it to sea level before self-destructing.
