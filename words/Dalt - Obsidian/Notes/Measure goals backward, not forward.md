# Measure goals backward, not forward
From a [[James Clear]] article and expanded on by [[Shane Parrish]], instead of looking at the next quarter or year and asking yourself, "What do I want to do?" or "What should I do in the upcoming time?"

Look back on the last week, quarter, or year and ask yourself what you want to more of and what you want to do less of. Often, the habits you enjoy doing are what you should be doing in the future and the stuff you don't like doing, you should be working towards getting those off your plate and onto someone else's. Obviously you can't do these for everything, but at least some things you can.
