# Could Aliens be communicating with us in a way that we haven't thought about yet?

- If they were super smart, they'd be able to figure out a way to communicate with us. If what they're doing isn't working for us, then they should be able to devise a way that we can understand.

This seems like the "beings" that used gravity to communicate in [[Interstellar]]
