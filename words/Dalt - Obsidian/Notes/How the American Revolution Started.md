xpThe first time the colonies began to seriously question the relationship between themselves and the mother country was after Parliament passed the Stamp Act—without any representation from the colonies in Parliament—which required any legal document or paper to require a stamp which cost money. "The Stamp Act was seen as a naked attempt to wring revenue from British subjects in America while their counterparts in England had no such obligations," Winston Groom writes in *The Patriots*. "Until the Stamp Act, John Adams reasoned, America's relationship with the mother country had been free, open, and tolerant."

The backlash to the Stamp Act created for Samuel Adams an audience for his ever-growing contempt for Britain, which led the creation of The Sons of Liberty, a quasi rebel group that began stirring up hate for England in Boston. The Stamp Act, however, was short-lived and things started to calm down.

But then England hit the colonies with more taxes, Townshend Duties. Named after Chancellor of the Exchequer, Charles Townshend, these duties taxed all tea, paints, glass, paper, and lead imported from Britain.

Although the Sons of Liberty—Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, Benedict Arnold, John Hancock, and Patrick Henry ("give me liberty, or give me death)—disbanded after The Stamp Act, they once again regrouped to organize mass protests and rallies.

The protests caused Lord Hillsborough, the king's secretary for colonial American affairs, to try and isolate Boston from the rest of the colonies, for he felt that's where the heart of the insurrection was. In 1768, he sent a letter "threatening to dissolve the general assembly of any colony that demanded repeal of the king's taxes and duties. To back this up, four regiments of British redcoats were dispatched to garrison the city of Boston." Those actions only caused more protest and rallies.

The influx of soldiers into Boston also caused Parliament to pass the Quartering Act, which forced the people of Boston to shelter and feed the troops.

After the Boston Massacre trial, which John Adams defended the soldiers honorably, the redcoats were ferried to a nearby island and things settled down. But this didn't last long.

Britain decided to get rid of the tea rotting in London warehouses by selling it at half-price. Since the Townshend Duties, the colonies were boycotting tea, but there was no way they could resist half-priced tea, the British thought. To get their tax money, though, they would put a threepence-a-pound duty on it. When word of this spread around Boston and the ships with tea started to arrive, Samuel Adams called a meeting for December 16. The events of that night are familiar to everyone, and The Boston Tea Party commenced.

Despite Adams' love for law and order, he praised the Tea Party, saying, "This is the most Magnificent movement of all. There is a dignity, a Majesty, a Sublimity, in this last effort of the Patriots that I admire...This Destruction of the tea is so bold, so daring, so firm, intrepid and inflexible and it must have so important Consequences, and so lasting that I cannot but Consider it as an Epocha in History."

Naturally, the British couldn't take this crap. So members of Parliament voted on four measures that came to be known as the Coercive Acts. To Americans, they would be known as the Intolerable Acts.

> They stipulated that Boston Harbor would be blockaded by British warships to all commerce until the cost of the destroyed tea was repaid; that Boston's fishing fleet was banned from tapping into the bounteous Grand Banks fishing ground; that the Massachusetts government would be solely appointed by agents of the Crown, even down to juries (the colony's house of representatives was retained, but its functions were strictly limited); that mass meetings were forbidden; that any British officials, including soldiers, accused of capital offenses would be shipped to England for a fair trial, as would be an British subjects accused of being "disturbers of the King's peace"; that an additional five regiments of redcoats, commanded by the Massachusetts military governor...would be camped on Boston Common, as well as the soldiers that had been quartered in Castle William. Essentially, Bostonians were put under martial law and, with the closing of the port, exposed to starvation.

Other colonies, also outraged by these measures, lent a hand. They sent food and sugar, promising to send enough to "withstand a ten-year siege."

> Samuel Adams read a motion he had prepared [in the house of representatives, which was banished to nearby Salem]: "That a General Congress of deputies meet at Philadelphia to consult together on the state of the colonies and to deliberate and determine upon wise and proper measures for the recovery of their just rights and liberties, civil and religious."

And this was how the First Continental Congress eventually met.

At that meeting, Congress voted to pass non-importation/exportation measures. These were essentially boycotts of all British imports and a refusal to export cotton and other crops to Britain. They also voted to encourage colonies to strengthen their various militias.

Between the First and Second Continental Congresses, battles at Lexington and Concord played out. There wasn't yet a full out war, but it was getting close. During the Second Continental Congress, there was debated between an all out break from Great Britain and independence, or a mere refusal of the Coercive acts, but with the goal to still stay with the Crown. The Olive Branch petition was created, which King George III promptly refused.

The question of an army was raised and Adams tossed Washington's name in the hat. With Adams's championing of the Virginia, Washington took the job, refusing pay, but asking for expenses to be reimbursed. On July 3, 1775, Washington left Philadelphia to commend the Patriot militia surrounding Boston.

After the ensuing battles, "Adams was so convinced that complete independence from Great Britain was going to be the end result of the present conflict that he wanted to advertise the fact with a 'declaration."

"A committee of five, led by John Adams, was selected to write the document. The other members were Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston...Jefferson produced the document in seventeen days." On July 4th, 1776, Congress voted in favor of the Declaration. "Americans by their own proclamation, were officially free of British rule. John wrote to Abigail that the date would be commemorated "as the Day of Deliverance," and that it would be "solemnized in Pomp and Parade with...Bonfires and Illuminations from one end of the Continent to the other from this time forward forever more."
