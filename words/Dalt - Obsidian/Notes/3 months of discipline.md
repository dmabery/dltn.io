The 3-month journey is a journey I'm embarking upon to be more disciplined in a few things:
- Going to the gym 3x/week
- Coding/practicing 5x/week
- Being more disciplined with YouTube - two videos per month from past articles. Basic editing.
- Writing and reading - reading just happens and writing happens when I feel inspired.
