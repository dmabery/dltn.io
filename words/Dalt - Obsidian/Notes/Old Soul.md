I've been called an old soul more than a few times in my life. Perhaps it's because I love typewriters, old books, and just about anything else made before 1920. Or, maybe it's just because I like to be in bed by 8:30 every night.

But whatever it is, I find that the nickname makes an appearance in conversations where we're talking about the simplicity of life, the beauty of the world, and the magnitude of great ideas.

So, perhaps what makes someone and "old soul," is just their ability to learn from the past, enjoy the present, and prepare for the future.

If that's the case, I think we all have a little bit of old soul in us.
