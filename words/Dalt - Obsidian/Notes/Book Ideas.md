### The Beginning of the Revolutionary War like Erik Larson

As I'm reading up about the Revolution more ([[The Patriots]]), I can't help but think how good a book would be that's in the style of [[Erik Larson]] with his temporal back-and-forth like he does with [[The Splendid and The Vile]] and [[The Demon of Unrest]]. One setting could be Parliament and their decision to tax the colonies. The other setting could be the colonies and how they rebelled and eventually claimed independence. I think the book would start somewhere after the Magna Carta and then end just before the Revolutionary War really kicked off. Or maybe skip over the war a bit and go into when Washington was elected, but I think that would be too much.

Could almost do a volume two that covers the War of 1812 and has the same back and forth from a temporal position.
