I don't understand why people even compare the two. They are vastly different platforms. True, both allow you to send emails to subscribers, but that's where there similarities change.

ConvertKit allows you to have total and complete control over how your newsletter looks in email service providers, and it keeps emails off the internet. If you have your own website that you've built over the last few years, and want your newsletters to show up there, ConvertKit is the way to go.

With Beehiiv, if you publish on your website, your email will be into two separate places on the internet. To me, that's...weird.

Now, if you *don't* have any blogging platform already, and want to use something that looks nice out of the box to send blog posts as emails, Beehiiv (or Substack) is the way to go. Those platforms give you everything you need to write online and make a living from it.

So if you're a solo creator looking to launch something with minimal technical setup, go Beehiiv or Substack. On the other hand, if you have a website that gets a good amount of traffic every week, maybe stick to ConvertKit. This way, you're not splitting your audience between two different places where your emails can live online.

Take someone like Tim Ferriss. He uses ConvertKit because his domain, tim.blog, gets massive amounts of traffic every week, and he wants his emails living on his site, and on his site only. He doesn't want two editions of Five Bullet Friday to be floating around on the internet.
