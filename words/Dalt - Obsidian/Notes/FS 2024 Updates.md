As we head into our team retreat, I wanted to provide a few updates and get everyone in sync. 

**Updates:**

**Currently Planned BIG things in 2024**

- DbD Feb 2024
- TGMM V1-4 Re-release/release - October 2024

**Top 4 FS priorities 2024**

- Newsletter 
- Podcast
- DBD Launch (Feb - Vicky is owner). 
- TGMM Book Launch (Shane is owner) 

Growth (newsletter / podcast) happens as a result of being excellent at the basics. People get lost when they focus on growth these as an objective. The score will take care of itself if we focus on what's within our control and are excellent at the basics. 

**Biggest opportunities I see**

- YouTube
- Titles/Descriptions on podcasts (why should people listen. How do we get someone interested). 
- I feel like people are waiting for me to push you and tell you what to do rather than take the lead. (My perception). 

**What I need:**

- My external to FS responsibilities are growing. 
- More support so I have more time to write, think, and recover from the past four years. You may have noticed we're cutting back on the number of things we have on the go at FS, and that will continue until I feel we can be excellent at what we are doing rather than mediocre at what we want to be doing. I'd like your help identifying things we're doing that do not make sense. 
- I am often the bottleneck on things - so taking away things you can do really well that you see me doing is helpful. 

**Agenda for Turks**

- **Tuesday AM 9-12 | Everyone | Vicky / Dalton to lead on operations and Youtube (respectively)**
- **Vicky | Operations 9-1030 -** I'd like you to look at roles and responsibilities for our common tasks (including what gets lost and where there are too many people in the kitchen, so to speak) as well as an an honest evaluation of where the team's time is spent with a look at what we can stop doing and where a little more time will make things noticeably better, low hanging fruit, etc. **if we can't be excellent at it, we should probably stop doing it.** Please provide a detailed write-up to everyone before Feb 1.
- **Dalton**  **| YouTube 1030-12** . ==**In advance, please create a detailed and comprehensive plan, including where we have been, what we have learned, and a 30-day plan to gain traction with the podcast on YouTube. Please provide a detailed write-up before Feb 1.**==   

**For details regarding write-ups (Marysol / Dalton / Vicky),** please take time to think about them. Each one will include different things, and different parts will have different levels of detail. I want to see your thinking. No power points - please share with everyone on the team when complete before Feb 1.

Things to cover:
- Social media
	- Figure out which topics work best on which platforms for the podcast, and post
	- Run the same play on FS Twitter as I have been. It's working. No need to change something that works.
- Podcast
	- Titles and descriptions
		- Are the pithy titles working? 
- YouTube
	- Thumbnail quotes, faces, clips, etc.
	- Trailers
	- Changing back-content
	- Recognizing that YouTube is like the stock market. Sometimes there are bear runs, and sometimes there are bull runs. But if we keep throwing in 500/month for the S&P, we'll grow our portfolio in two, four, and six years. Just because we have a few months, or even a year, of lower-than-average views, subscribers, or revenue, does not mean the channel is dying. Nor does it mean we have to completely upend our process. 
	- The basics we can control:
		- We can always be playing with titles and thumbnails from past episodes, and ensuring each clip we post and full-length podcast is immediately engaging from the start (adding the hook/trailer), and cutting out all of the fluff.
		- Posting at the time most of our subscribers are active and ensuring all posts on social media are going out within five minutes of the YouTube video going live so we get a big push in the first 10 minutes to an hour. Doing this doesn't have that much of an affect on the overall performance of a video. If a video is not interesting to our audience, it can be a 1/10 the first day, but then taper off. Alternatively, if the video is great and doesn't have the execution, it will get picked up in the algorithm, eventually. My job is to ensure the videos that will get picked up are picked up the quickest, and to position the episodes with guests that are less well known in the most interesting and engaging style.
- We also have control over the *types* of videos we make. We could do Q&As that are exclusive to YouTube once or twice a year (you can never have too many Q&As); special, rapid-fire questions at the end of an interview with guests who are well known and we have good video for; behind the scenes (how guests get booked, filming, research, editing, publish-day); if a guest is an expert in something tangible (coffee, fitness equipment, etc.), we could have them test variations on screen and decide which is the best one, for a separate piece of content all together; video compilations of the best insights on sleep, fitness, health, productivity, etc. Sort of like TKP Insights, but more explicit, and filmed like a traditional YouTube video. Ali Abdaal has a good example of this.
