# The only way to avoid disappointment is to expect it.

If you're trying to do something that has never been done before, the odds of it working on the first or second try are slim to none. That's reality.

But that's okay, because you learn. You learn what didn't go right. You learn how not to do something.

However, if you're too busy being disappointed about the failure, you'll never work up enough courage to try it, or anything else, ever again.

The only way to avoid that soul-crushing disappointment is to expect it's arrival. Not in a pessimistic, woe is me, Eeyore type of way. But in a realistic, "This thing I'm trying to do has never been done before, so I 100% expect something to go wrong" type of way. The next time around, expect 97% of things to go wrong. Then 92% of things. And so on.
