# Clans and groups ability to scale up is dependent on the social and psychological fit between what exists in the group and the new norm or belief

p. 98 of [[B - WEIRDest People in the World]]

"Novel norms and beliefs must emerge from a group's existing cultural repertoire, or, if copied from other groups, they must mesh with the indigenous institutions."

Basically, if an idea is too novel or new, it's not going to get adopted by a group. But if the new thing is *similar* to something the group already has, believes, or does, it is much more likely to get appended to that and adopted.
