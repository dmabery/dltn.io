[[DOAC Notes Clean]]
- What is it you want to achieve? This will always dictate what you post, why you post, and when you post it. **You have to be super clear at what you're trying to achieve** and make sure you have the ability to measure whether or not that is or isn't working.
- Organic channels are all about reach. You want to create shares, information, and more.
- **What's our why?** We want to help others master the best of what other people have already figured out. Everything we publish, promote, and create should point back to this mantra. Is this helping someone else learn and become better? Better yet, is this helping someone who doesn't already know us learn and become better? If the latter, what can we do to ensure they get "locked" into our ecosystem.
- Short form should *not* be looked at as ads for the long-form piece. People who scroll IG Reels are unlikely to listen through a two hour podcast on YouTube. The goal with repurposing content is to keep people engaged with your content and interacting with it who otherwise *wouldn't* be.
	- They know which topics work on which platforms. On IG, health (mental and physical) and relationships works well on IG
	- Careers, work, entrepreneurship works on LinkedIn
		- **Action: What are the topics that work well across our various channels? Look back at the most liked/viewed videos.**
	- The clip editors work "religiously" to make sure the clips have the best story arcs (has it got a beginning, middle, and end; does it end leaving the viewer with a sense of "completeness" - if not, they feel like they got cheated), hooks (which may not be the start of the clip)
	- There is no standard of clip quantity for a podcast to meet. Some episodes you might get two clips; others, you'll get 20! That's ok. Not every guest is fitting for every platform.
	- How can you level up your short form? Comedy, BTS, sound, graphics, subtitle colors, 10 minute clips vs. 10 second clips? These all change, so you have to keep trying new things.
	- What can you film before and after the professional filming that you can post *just* on social. Have a short-form first mentality. Stuff that gets cut during the edit because it's funny.
	- TKP social-first strategy, aside from just repurposing podcast clips? Podcasts platforms are not a growth channel.
- Trailers - How do you get someone to watch something? How do you get them wanting more? Serve them a juicy hook, draw them in, and leave them with wanting more at the end.
	- Formula: Position the problem + demonstrate the solution (don't reveal the solution) = tease them into come and watch more
	- What would the trailer look like if I had an hour? How about a day? What would it look like if I had an entire week?
- Experiments - Experimenting is the key to growth. If you aren't experimenting, you will not grow. Things are always changing, so you have to be changing.
	- AB testing thumbnails and titles - Every episode there are 100 thumbnails being tested. A week before, they are running 100 thumbnails using three different facial expressions, run them up until the day before the podcast comes out, and look at the CTR and titles/thumbnails to see what people want to hear about.
	- They have researchers looking up what topics/guests are starting to surface and send a list to Steve for him to talk about/find guests to talk with. Then, they run those as thumbnails and titles to see what people are more interested in and inclined to click on and engage with. This leads to the topics that Steve talks about and adds to the topics and clips they lead with on social.
- Titles and thumbnails - How do you sell a podcast with someone no one has ever heard of? THIS IS THE KEY FOR US TO MASTER!!!!!
	- Look at the backend of YouTube to figure out what topics perform well, what are people interested in *around* the guests area of interest? Niche down and figure out what will trigger algorithmic shifts.
	- The real trick to the title: really understanding what people they can solve that's broad enough so a wide range of people are interested in and specific enough for certain people to feel like *this is the one you have to listen to*
	- What are the criteria every title and thumbnail has to pass before it can get into the testing phase?
- Engaging with the target communities they want to engage with the podcast before the episode goes live. The thought here: the faster they can speed up an episode being shared from when it's posted, the better, so they get the first ten-minute and first hour rush. 
	- How can you hack the algorithm? You optimize for that first hour. The first 24 hours.
	- TubeBuddy thumbnail testing.
	- The algorithm is matching up who they think the video is for and the people you want to listen. When those doors overlap, that's the key.
	- Physically put your podcast in front of the audiences who are going to watch it.
- Paid socials
	- Upload the trailer and clips to paid promo and specifically target the audience that guest is talking about.
	- They had a South African DJ on and it was performing okay. They paid to promote it to a South African audience and all the sudden the video took off - "hockey sticks"
		- Pushing the trailer, sometimes static quotes
- Campaigns -
