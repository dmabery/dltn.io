# If people in different spheres of influence are all saying the same thing, it's probably a good idea.


If your great-grandpa tells you something your grandma told you and also your mother tells you, it's safe to say that piece of advice is worth listening to since it lasted for 4 generations.

Similarly, if people in different domains of expertise are saying something similar with different words, it's probably wise to pay attention to whatever that may be. There are limitations to this piece of advice of course, but it's pretty wide-reaching.

If your boss recommends a book, you may put it in the back of your mind and think, 'Huh, I'll have to check it out.' Later, if your friend tells you to check out the same book, you are a little bit more inclined to buy the book. And if you hear someone reccomend it again on a podcast or something, odds are you've decided to add the book to your list and buy it. This is how it should work with life advice and other decisions that you seek feedback on.
