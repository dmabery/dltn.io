# Clocks sent around the world on a plane time travel
Two atomic clocks are compared. One is held stationary and another is sent on commercial planes around the world with the destination of its original starting point. When it returned, it showed less time had elapsed than its partner. That time difference shows that clock had somehow jumped ahead into the future, arriving back at a later time that in was reading. Though it was a small measurement, it still happened.
