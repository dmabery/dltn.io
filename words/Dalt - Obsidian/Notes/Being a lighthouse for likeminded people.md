> Be a lighthouse for likeminded people

Building in public, writing, talking about code, science, and history gives me an opportunity to be a lighthouse for the people that enjoy those same topics! There are so many people in the world and the internet allows you to be friends with anyone. Gone are the days of only knowing the people in your high school or college and feeling like a freak for wanting to talk about history, science, or programming.

On the internet, you are able to reach the certain population of people who love talking about development and also ate trying to [[Study history and science to understand how we got to now ]]
