#law-school 

Need to explain why I decided to enroll in McGeorge now instead of trying to get into another school: because moving wasn’t an option with Kendal’s transplant so fresh.

I didn’t want to postpone my life any more then we are already forced to, so I wanted to behind my legal training, with hopes of transferring to a school that had programs more aligned with my interests. I didn’t really know what type of law I wanted to practice, so getting experience my first year, I was able to see where I wanted to specialize in, and then could make decisions about what schools to transfer into based on that.
