# The exploration time is used ineffectively and they lost everything they were exploring

Another reason the exploration phase is hard is because it feels very forced. Once you decide to start writing about an idea, you have to look for sources and read things that coincide with that idea to give you content.

But if you're constantly in a state of exploration, and have a way to organize what you're exploring, you suddenly have a pile of unexplored notes that relate to what you're writing about. From there, it's as simple as connecting what you have previously explored and then executing on those ideas.
