During my internship at a large church in California, the students were separated into two tracks: worship and leadership.

Worship students spent a lot of their time learning how to do worship, writing songs, and practicing their instruments. Leadership students spent a lot of time planning events, hanging out with younger students (since most of us were leading high school or middle school ministry programs), and helping out around the campus.

One day, while hearing my worship-track friends talk about how they were all put into groups to write and produce a song, I thought it was the coolest thing. Thinking about it later, I remember wondering how those of us in the leadership-track can practice our craft.

I asked a few mentors, but no one gave me a satisfying answer other than reading books (which I was doing).

It's no surprise someone much smarter than me has an elegant way of putting this quandary. Tyler Cowen, [on his podcast](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/learn-like-an-athlete-knowledge-workers-should-train.html), almost always asks guests, “What is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?”

In a [blog post](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/how-i-practice-at-what-i-do.html), Cowen listed some things he does that are beneficial to him, and anyone else, who wishes to get a little bit smarter every day.

As a writer, I think I "practice my scales" in three ways:

1. Learning the ins-and-outs of the English language so I can know the rules (and how to break them) and expand my vocabulary.
2. Reading widely to learn how other writers, comic book authors, bloggers, journalists, scientists, etc., manipulate the English language through words to create meaning and share information.
3. This is an obvious one, but writing every day. I can't expect to be a better runner if I don't frequently; how can I expect to be a better writer if I don't write frequently?
