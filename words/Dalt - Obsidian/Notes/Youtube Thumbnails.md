I'm convinced that YouTube titles are more important than thumbnails. They're both important, of course, but I think a video that equally delivers on its promise will perform better with a phenomenal title and a mediocre thumbnail than with a mediocre title and a great thumbnail. Here's why: People don't look at the thumbnail first. They look at titles. If the title is interesting, they'll look at the thumbnail and decide to click. If the title isn't interesting, they'll glance over the thumbnail while they find something else.
