# Ben Franklin's Plan for Future Conduct
On a return trip from London, as Franklin was just starting his expansive journey of life that would cross many domains, he wrote a "Plan For Future Conduct", after he realized most of his life up to that point just happened. He wasn't being intentional about it. That would change with this creed:

> 1. It is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time, till I have paid what I owe.
>
> 2. To endeavor to speak truth in every instance; to give nobody expectations that are not likely to be answered, but aim at sincerity in every word and action â€” the most amiable excellence in a rational being.
>
> 3. To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand, and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of growing suddenly rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty.
>
> 4. I resolve to speak ill of no man whatever, not even in a matter of truth; but rather by some means excuse the faults I hear charged upon others, and upon proper occasions speak all the good I know of everybody.
