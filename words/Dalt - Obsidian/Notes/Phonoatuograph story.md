# Phonoatuograph story
This is Ã‰douard-LÃ©on Scott de Martinville. 20 years before the phonograph, he patented a machine that recorded sound.

He'd published a book on shorthand writing and after reading how vibrations affect the ear in a textbook, he thought a machine could write down sounds.

His machine captured sound waves though a funnel with a stylus on the end. The vibrations from the sound would move the horn and the stylus would etch the corresponding waves.
  
He called it the phonautograph.

His problem: there was no way to play the sound back.

He assumed humans would be able to read the etchings of the stylus on the scroll, because that's what stenographers did.

Nonetheless, this was the beginning of recording sounds. It's wild to me that the vibrations from sound can be transferred and recorded in an analog "waveform."
