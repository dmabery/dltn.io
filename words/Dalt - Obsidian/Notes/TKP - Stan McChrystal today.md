- You can't really do much to control threats, because they are caused by other people and other situations. You can, however, mitigate those threats by reducing your vulnerabilities. In a practical sense, this looks like using a secure password and password manager for accounts. The threat of getting hacked is still out there, but the likelihood it will now happen to you is reduced, because your reducing your vulnerabilities. #idea 
- [[The blind men and the elephant]] analogy could be used for note-taking. When you have all these separate notes, then you have a bunch of half-ideas all over the place. But when you combine then and make the connections, you can see things as a much bigger picture.
- Politicians, military members, companies, employees, etc., all have a different time cycle. So they all may want the same thing in the end, but want to achieve it on a faster or slower timeline. This causes conflicts and disagreements. Then, people start arguing about the conflicts and forget that they all want the same thing.
	- A politician fighting for something that will take 10 years is going to be very difficult. So then they find a compromise of something short term that is usually 20% of what the long term goal was. But this means that solution is 80% less effective. So now we have ineffective, short term policies, projects, and people running around like chickens with their heads cut off. 
- **Why people are indecisive**
	- People are indecisive because they're used to getting more and more information as the situation progresses. They do this because they're trying to get the uncertainty down to the point where the next action is obvious and everyone would agree on it. But a lot of situations, most situations in life that is, you can't do that. So instead, they try to gather more and more information and end up not doing anything at all. Or, going back and forth on their decision. 
- **Commander's Intent**
	- If everything in this mission goes to hell, but we get this one thing done, it's a success. This is the core goal of the mission and it makes it clear for everyone involved. 
- Most organizations don't incentivize good decisions and they punish failure. So, there's absolutely no benefit to taking any sort of risk at all.
	- When you make a mistake and get punished for it and don't get a second chance, then all of that experience is gone - disappeared into the wind.
	- You don't want to create an environment where people just do whatever because they won't be held accountable though.
	- Ask leaders who the people who failed significantly in the past and where they are now. Usually, they won't be around. That's a sure sign they just say they want people to take risks and don't actually mean it. 
- Don't expect perfection from admired leaders. Expect humanity.
- Commit yourself to some thing. A cause, an organization, a people, or all of those things. And it has to be more than you. If there's nothing to it, there isn't much there and there will always be a fragility.
