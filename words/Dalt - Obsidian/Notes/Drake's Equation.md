# Drake's Equation

- An equation created by Cornell professor named Frank Drake. It's aim is to compare the number of stars in the solar system, to the number of stars that are likely to have planetary systems. You then divide that by the number of systems that could theoretically hold life, then divide that by the number of how many civilizations could have advanced to intelligence. With this equation, just in the Milky Way, the number of potential advanced civilizations works out to somewhere in the million.
