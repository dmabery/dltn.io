## Quotes
- Consistency is proficiency - if you want to be really, really good at something, you have to be consistent with that. That consistency, over a long-enough time horizon, will eventually lead to proficiency. This reminds me of [[You have to be bad in order to be good.]]
- What is real is the people who love you. You don’t trust yourself because you don’t think you’re good enough. **But consistency always comes before proficiency**. The first step is identifying what you’re willing to do every day for the rest of your life.
	- *If consistency always comes before proficiency, instead of wondering how to be great at something, you should figure out how to do that thing everyday for years and years to come.*
