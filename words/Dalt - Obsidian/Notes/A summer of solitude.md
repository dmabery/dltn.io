Rest is hard.

I find it quit difficult to sit still unless I'm engrossed in a movie (lately: Mudbound and Fight Club).

Rest is especially after the last three months. My wife and I moved to Palo Alto in March. I say moved, but really we were forced here. She had a double-lung transplant from Stanford and living by the hospital for three months post-op is part of the deal. I guess there are worse places to be tied down to but still, it's not home.

Not being home is stressful. It doesn't feel like a vacation, because I'm still working and we're going to doctor's appointments a few times per week. Plus, I'm not surrounded by a body of water. For some reason, being around a body of water signals to my body: *rest*. I do not know why.

I used to think "rest" meant sitting on the couch not doing anything, but that's not rest, though I guess it could be.
