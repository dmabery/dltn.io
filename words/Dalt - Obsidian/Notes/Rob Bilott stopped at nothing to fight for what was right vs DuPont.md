Watched the movie Dark Water today, about DuPont and their chemical C-8 or PFOA. This chemical is the residue left from burning Teflon at very high temperatures and was discarded in inhumane ways in Parkersburg, West Virginia.

Rob Bilott is the name of the lawyer, and he used all of DuPont's internal research, though it was thousands and thousands of documents, to prove they knew what they were doing for decades. They poisoned an entire town. And they almost won, too. But Bilott fought and fought and fought to win $670 million in settlement and made this a popular case. To this day, he's still an environmental lawyer.
