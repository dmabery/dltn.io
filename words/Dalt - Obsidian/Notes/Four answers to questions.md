Having these answers handy forces you to come up with tangible results, numbers, and lessons. There's nothing worse than asking a question and hearing blabber and nonsense come from someone else's mouth because they don't know how to say "I don't know the answer to that", so instead, take a roundabout course that communicates that they don't know to both themselves and the listener without actually saying those dreaded words.
