# When Einstein Walked with Gòdel

- 112 Mercer Street - the address of Einstein’s house in New Jersey where Godel and he would walk to and fro.
- “Every chaos is a wrong appearance.” - Godel
- Godel’s nickname was _der Herr Warum_, ‘Mr. Why’
- When Godel became a US Citizen, he became agitated when he began explaining to a judge how the U.S. Constitution contained a loophole that would allow a dictatorship to come into existence. Luckily, Einstein was there to calm him down.
- Godel had discovered within Einstein’s equations for relativity a way for time travel to be possible. If a universe was rotating and not expanding and an observer saw the all the other planets spinning around him, he could complete a long trip in a rocket ship and then travel back to a point in his own past. Some people were pleased that time travel seemed to obey the laws of physics. But what Godel observed was that if time travel was possible, time isn’t real at all because if you can go back to a past event, well, then, it hadn’t really _passed_.
- “To those of us who believe in physics, Einstein wrote to a widow, “this separation between past, present, and future is only an illusion, if a stubborn one.”

### 2. Time - The Grand Illusion

- “Absolute, true, mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external.” – Newton at the beginning of _Principia_.
- “Irresisitibly, irreversibly, we are being borne toward our deaths at the stark rate of one second per second. As the past slips out of exisistence behind us, the future, once unknown and mysterious, assumes its banal reality before us as it yields to the ever-hurrying now.” – Author
- “The objective world simply is; it does not happen.” Hermann Weyl
- Time, according to Einstein, is not reality and belongs in the realm of appearance. The only objective way to see the universe is as God sees it: _sub specie aeternitatis_.
- The Boltzman brain is like a perfect recreation of your brain.
- Arthur Eddington had the idea that since our intuitive sense of the passage of time is so powerful, it must correspond to something in the objective world.
- According to William James, “spacious present”, or our brain’s ability to take in new data happens on an interval of about three seconds.

### 3. Number’s Guy: The Neuroscience of Math

- The number area of the brain lies deep within a fold in the parietal lobe called the intraparietal sulcus, which is just beyond the crown of the head.
- Give a calculator to a five-year old and you will teach them how to make friends with numbers instead of despising them.
- 1, 2, and 3 are vertical bars joined together so it makes it easy to write. Pretty neat!

### 4. The Riemann Zeta Conjecture and the Laughter of the Primes

- If you conclude there is nothing special about the moment or thing that you’re experiencing (ie: it’s not the first time it has happened or the last time it has happened), then you can be 95% sure that is has no more than _n X_ 39 events left (where _n_ is how many events it has already had) and no fewer than _n/39._ This the known as Copernican reasoning.
    
    - Is this similar to the Lindy Effect? Is the Lindy Effect the layman’s terms for writing about Copernican Reasoing?
- There are two types of numbers: primes and composite.
    
    - Every composite number can be put together in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers. This is called the fundamental theory of arithmetic.
- Proposition 20 of Euclid’s _Elements_ states that there are infinitely many prime numbers. His reasoning is that if there were a finite amount of prime numbers, then you could multiply them all together, add one, and that would give you a new number. This number would have to be either a prime number or be divisible by another prime number that wasn’t yet on the list.
    
- “There is no apparent reason why one number is a prime and another not,” declared Don Zagier at his inaugural lecture at Boston University in 1975. “To the contrary, upon looking at these numbers one has a feeling of being in the presence of one of the inexplicable secrets of creation.”
    
- The Zeta function is the harmonic series (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) raised to the variable power _S._
    
- It’s interesting that prime numbers are the way that they are because _that’s just how it is_. It may be one of the few things in life–quite possibly the only in life–that just is because that’s the way that it is.
    
- Every good joke is a disrupted syllogism. – Schopenhauer Example: The important thing is sincerity. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.

- Read: The usefulness of useless knowledge and A Mathmatician’s Apology
- Matthew Harris on pure mathematics: ‘Every veil lifted only reveals another veil.”
- Something is self-similar when each part of it echoes the whole thing.
- Zipf’s Law - Developed by George Kingsley Zipf is another example of a Power Law or Pareto distribution, where a few words do all of the work and the rest merely make an appearance every now and then.
- What are Mandalbrot Set?
- “It used to be said that a mathematics department was the second cheapest for a university to fund, since it required only pencils, paper, and wastebaskets. (The cheapest would be the philosophers, because they don’t need the wastebaskets.”

– Jim Holt

- We live in a three dimensional world because a three dimensional world is the only on where intelligent life like us would be able to be created. This is called “anthropic” reasoning.
- The Four Color Theorem seems simple to prove…but in reality it would involve showing that every conceivable map, of which there are and will be infinitely many, could be colored with only four colors, no matter how numerous the regions are.
- The crucial step to mathematical inductions is showing that if such and such is true for _n,_ it has to also be true for _n+1._ In the 4-color map problem, if someone shows that a map with _n_ number of regions can be colored with only 4 colors, they must also show that a map with _n+1_ number of regions can be colored with only for colors as well..and so on.
- One way of thinking about 4 color problem, is assuming there is a map with a region that has 5 or less regions. You can shrink one region down to a point and color in the 4 remaining region with the 4 colors. Then, you can blow up the region you shrunk and fill that in with a different color than the three neighbors. This only works if the point you chose is one that has three neighbors.
- Newton got the idea for infinitesimals in calculus, well the idea of calculus itself, when he wanted to determine the orbit of the planets. Instead of trying to arrive at the shape of the orbit all at once, he would break the orbit into an infinite number of segments and then sum up the effects of the Sun’s gravitational force on each of the segments. Instantaneous velocity–something which had defied most of Newton’s predecessors–was now defined as the ratio of two very small quantities: the infinitesimal distance traveled in an infinitesimal amount of time.
- Voltaire, after attending Newton’s royal funeral said, “Not long ago, a distinguished company were discussing the trite and frivolous question: ‘Who is the greatest man, Cesear, Alexander, Tamerlane, or Cromwell?’ Someone answered that without a doubt it was Isaac Newton. **And rightly: for it is to him who masters our minds by the force of truth, not to those who enslave them by violence, that we owe our reverence.**
- Atoms are made of protons and electrons…those are made up of quarks…is that as far as it goes? Reminds me of the ‘who created God’ question? At some point, _something_ has to have created _something else_. But if infinity as an idea exists, can’t that process just go on and on for infinity?
- Ada Lovelace after learning about her father, Lord Byrons, devilish acts:

”I have an ambition to make a compensation to mankind for his misused genius. If he has transmitted to me any portion of that genius, I would use it to bring out great truths and principles. I think he has bequeathed this task to me.”
