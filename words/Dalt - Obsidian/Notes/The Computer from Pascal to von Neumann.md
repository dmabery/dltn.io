# The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann

## Notes

- Since its inception from Liebenz and Pascal, the computer has always had one goal: to free men of the tedious tasks of calculating so they have more time to work and think. At first, the tasks computers could automate were simple (addition and subtraction) and then got a bit more complex (multiplying and dividing) and now are getting ever more complex (writing, conversing, thinking critically).
- Charles Babbage was inspired to come up with his idea for how cards should program the Analytical Engine by Jacquard’s weave for cotton p.20
- Babbage was the first real Computer Scientist, other than Liebenz and Pascal. His machines, though were never actually built, have all the working pieces that a calculating machine would need.
- The Three Body Problem owes to its genesis Newton’s contemplations of the accurate motion of the moon. This Lunar Theory, “made his Newton’s head ache and kept him awake so often that he would think of it no more.”
- George Boole and his “mathematicalization” of logic is probably one of the most important ideas for the basis of computing. There are essentially two main operations in this system _and_ and _or_ and they currently allow computers to do what they do.
    - This paragraph on page 37 is super confusing, but I want to understand it. The whole book is pretty confusing honestly. I think it will give me a good big picture understanding of computing, but I’ll need to read more about the individual bits and bobs because they aren’t explained simply enough.
- The next big development was in 1890 and the subsequent years that followed when a Census was taken. Many men, including what would become IBM, worked on creating a system of punchcards to tally data by a machine. The cards had spots for holes in it and, if a certain hole was punched, it would advance the counter on that characteristic (black vs. white for example). Apparently, John Shaw Buildings saw people doing the work manually and commented that there must be a way to do so via a machine, “something on the principle of the Jacquard loom, whereby holes in a card regulate the pattern to be woven.”
