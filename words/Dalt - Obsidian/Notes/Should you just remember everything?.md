(Betteridg'e Law of Headlines: If a title ends in a question, the answer is 'No.' Lest, I continue.)

There's a long-lasting debate between productivity aficionados who have entire systems for "getting things done" and those who just get things done.

The argument is whether or not having a task manager, or writing down tasks in some way, is important. The productivity people, of course, think you should write everything down. The "just do it" people argue that if something is important enough, it'll get done because you'll just remember to do it. And if you don't remember to do it, the task wasn't important enough to worry about anyway.

I agree with both..and disagree with both.

If you're engaged, you don't need to write down "Get married" as a task. That should—hopefully—be exciting enough that you won't forget that's on the horizon.
