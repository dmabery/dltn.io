Nowhere is the idea of doing a little bit every day more obvious than cleaning your house.

When you put things away at the end of the day, your house is perpetually clean. Sure, over time dust and such will add up, requiring you to do more of a deep clean, but rarely will you feel cluttered.

But if you go days and weeks without putting anything away, stuff gets everywhere. Then, the task is almost too daunting to undertake because it'll take an hour or more.

But if you just did a little bit everyday, it would take just ten minutes or so.

Do a little bit every day.
