Einstein's paper in 1917 that explained earth was finite, but had no boundaries.

He first imagined earth as infinite, and said if that was the case, there would be nothing holding the stars and planets in place and they would drift all over the place.

But a finite universe, drifting in some arbitrary place in space was also highly unlikely.

So he thought of a third option, a finite universe with no boundaries. Think of it like a two-dimensional plane wrapped on a sphere. No mater where you go, you won't hit any boundaries, but you also can't keep going in a straight line forever. If you do that, you'll just end up back on the same spot on the sphere. This is what the universe is like. Or as Einstein proposed in his 1917 paper.

The problem with this theory at the time, was that according to his equations, a universe that stood still was implausible because the gravitational forces would just pull all the matter together. (Why would this happen? #question)

The universe would have to either imploding on itself or expanding. They didn't know at the time it was expanding. [[The universe is expanding because galaxies are shifting to red light, which proves they are moving further from us because light stretches in space the further it travels]]
