Every good story-at-sea has at least two of three elements: a shipwreck, murder, or mutiny. While this tale definitely had the second, the third is questionable, and the first doesn't appear at all.

While Richard Snow does his best to recount the complicated and mysterious story aboard the *Somers*, as a reader, I'm left wanting. The story itself is magnificent.

In 1848, the *Somers*, a US brig-of-war, set out from New York Harbor on a journey south with young naval officers. Its mission was to deliver papers, but its real mission was to teach its young crew what sea-faring life was like. (The Naval Academy at Annapolis was yet to exist, and, as a result of what happened on this ship, would be created.)

Aboard the ship was Phillip Spencer, a "young punk" who just so happened to be the son of the Secretary of War for President John Tyler. Events ensued aboard the ship—a supposed mutiny led by Spencer—which caused Captain Alexander Mckenzie to hang Philip Spencer and two of his comrades.

The first half of the book explains the background of some of the crew and the events that lead to the eventual hanging. The second half covers the dramatic "inquiry" and court-martial into Captain Mckenzie's behavior that sought to determine 1. Was a mutiny *really* going to happen? And 2. If so, was hanging the culprits necessary?

Spoiler alert: Mckenzie got off scot-free. At both the "inquiry"—a formal investigation simply to gather facts—and the subsequent court-martial, the captain's behavior was deemed appropriate, and he faced no punishment. Philip Spencer's father, and the bride of another hanged, were calling for Mckenzie's prosecution for murder.

And that's the story. Dramatic and entertaining? Yes. But I think Snow could have done a better job writing it. My biggest critique (which a professional, I am not), was that the author relied too heavily on direct quotes. In a story like this, having primary sources are important, but at times, the frequent direct quotes stopped the flow of the story.

For example:

> On March 28, "the court met this day in pursuance of adjournment...And the court being cleared, the court proceeded to consider the charges and specifications, and to make their finding thereon."

What?

Why not just write, "On March 28, the court met to consider the arguments and determine a verdict." I understand the appeal to quoting the direct source, but the quote is just cumbersome.

I also personally didn't like how, in the first few pages, he referenced two modern-day inventions as an analogy. I don't think modern-day references should *ever* be in a history book unless to provide greater context for inflation or geography. Not only that, but I especially don't think Disney or a Ferrari should be referenced as a figure of speech:

> Seeing the *Somers* among her fellow warships, a viewer from our time might have been reminded of a Ferrari parked new some Chevrolet Suburbans.
> 
> [...]
> 
> To the New York of the 1840s, a town whose life was maritime trade, pirates were far from the merry rascals one can visit today in a Disney park.

The Disney analogy makes a little more sense, but still, why? It takes a reader out of the story and the little world the book is trying to create and reminds them they're *reading* a story, not living it. 

Still, like with any part of history, there is much to learn. Mainly, one is left asking why Mckenzie risked his career to hang the Secretary of War's son on mere *talk* of mutiny and a picture of a ship with a black flag. Such is the lesson to takeaway from this. It's hard to undo hanging someone, yet it seemed as if Captain Mckenzie was set on this method of discipline from the very beginning. Why?

It's theorized in the epilogue of the book that his decision was intentional. In a time of peace, it would be hard for a ship captain to become famous, as many of his peers did in the Battle of 1812.

So, was the decision to hang the son of such a prominent figure Mckenzie's way of being remembered? Perhaps. Here we are two hundred years later still talking about him.
