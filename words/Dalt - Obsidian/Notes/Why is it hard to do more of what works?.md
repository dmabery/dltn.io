We want complicated solutions to our seemingly complicated problems. Complication makes us feel good. It makes us feel like we're smarter than everyone else. It makes us feel like we are working harder than everyone else.

Great take. This goes back to this idea I've been stewing on that simple solutions will not work for people who think their problems are complex.

  

How to write a book? Write words every day. "No, no. Surely it can't be that simple I need a system and an outline and a plan and the right pen."

  

How to get in shape? Run, lift weights, don't eat junk. "No no. Surely it can't be that simple. I need a plan, a routine, a trainer, a meal service."

  

They want something that makes them feel like they have an "edge" over others.
