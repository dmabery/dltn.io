As much as I love digital tools, there's something about the everlasting quality of paper and journals that is appealing to me.

I've also been reading an absolutely amazing Substack lately called Noted from Professor blah that does a deep dive into people's journals and handwritten notebooks that I love. When I'm fifty, I want to look back on my papers and see what I was learning when I was 25. I think it would be an awesome thing to share with my grandkids.

So this year I'm trying a new version of a commonplace book, and my system has two parts.

The first is conducted while reading, and the second after I finish the book.

Part 1: The notebook

Since September of last year, whenever I read a book, I keep this notebook close by. When I come across a passage I want to learn, a quote I want to record, or an idea I want to read about or make sure I remember, I write the page number down in the notebook, copy the passage, and add any commentary.

At the beginning of the notebook, I have a table of contents that comes in handy. Since I read multiple books at once, I wanted to make sure I could notes on multiple books at once. This may not be the cleanest method to do this, but it works for me. When I stop reading one book, but I'm not finished with it yet, I add three stars in the center of the page of my notebook. I then write the title of the book I switched to, and make sure to add the page number those notes are on to the title's entry in the table of contents.

This ensures I can find all the entries from the same book, while also giving me flexibility to read multiple books at once and take notes on all of them without wasting paper or trying to guess how many pages a certain book will need. I've also found it be a bit serendipitous. I was reading a book about John Adams and Thomas Jefferson at the same time, and a passage from each of the books ended up on neighboring pages that gave differing perspectives to the same event.

Part 2: The computer (and notecards)

When I'm finished with a book, I always type up my notes in Obsidian and post them on my website. I know the journals will last a long time, but having my notes in a digital format does multiple things. First, it helps me remember and synthesize the information better. Because I would have read the best parts and written them down in my notebook, by the time I post them to my website, I've reviewed them three times. This helps me remember the key insights. Even if I don't memorize every details, the essence of the idea or story is in my head, and I know where to look when I need to recall that idea.

The best quotes, insights, and lessons also get written down or printed out on these little 4X6 notecards, and filed away in their respective categories. Having the notes on my website ensures all the notes from a book stay together, while the notecards provide me with flexibility to take the interesting passages from different books and organize them my category. Sooner or later, I'll have dozens of cards full of quotes and stories about death, anger, working hard, learning, and other themes I care about, to learn, write, and synthesize from - all from some of the best and brightest people in history.
