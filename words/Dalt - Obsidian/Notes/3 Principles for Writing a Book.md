1. All publishing is self-publishing

No one is going to care about the book more than you do. So think like a self-publisher and work as hard as they would.

2. Get famous first

3. You are the CEO of your own multimedia empire

Know what you're writing. Are you writing a true work of art? Or is it a 'one-pound business card?'
