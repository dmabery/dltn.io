# Are you playing a game you want to win?

**If you win at whatever game you're playing right now, would you be happy?**

This is such an amazing question to ask yourself. The best thing about it is that it can apply to so many contexts.

For me, I think about it in terms of content creation and the persona I'm trying to create for myself online and relates to [[Why I'm Learning how to code and not how to build an audience]]. I want to win the game by building an amazing product, creating an inspiring video, or writing a ground-breaking article.

Is that going to take time? Yes.
Will other people succeed faster than me? Yes.

But I want to win the game that I want want to play. In other words, **I don't want to win a game I never wanted to play in the first place.**
