When the ball is hit your way, what are you going to do with it?

Baseball IQ.

It's about being prepared for situations you expect, leaving enough room to react appropriately for the situations you don't expect.

From Derek Jeter:

"Time [or the game] slows down when you're prepared and speeds up when you're unprepared." "Every time you're in a situation, I've already gone through it in my head."
