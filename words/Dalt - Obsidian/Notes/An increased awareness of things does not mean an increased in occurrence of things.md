This happens to all of us: as soon as we start shopping for something new, we see it *everywhere*. It's an eerie phenomenon.

It's happened to me a lot, but I remember one time the most clearly. My wife and I had just gotten to Palo Alto for doctor's appointments and we were a few seasons into watching the show Veep. We sat down on the couch to watch it, and the VP makes a reference about Palo Alto!

"How funny!" I thought. "What are the odds. They've never mentioned California before, and now, as soon as we're in Palo Alto, the first episode we watch, the mention Palo Alto!"

But it turns out, they mentioned California in *a lot* of other episodes. I just didn't notice it.
