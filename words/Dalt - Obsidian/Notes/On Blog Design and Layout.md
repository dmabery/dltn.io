Or: The Blog Layout You Choose Communicates Who You Are

There are two types of online blogs. The first type is the more traditional style of web-logs where bloggers post short ideas, commentaries, and relative links at a semi-regular and sporadic pace. One of the most popular blogs doing this today is Marginal Revolution. Occasionally, Tyler Cowen or Alex will post original long-form essays, but most often they are linking to interesting articles they find online and providing commentary. Austin Kleon follows this format. Seth Godin does too.

The second type of blog is less traditional and slowly being taken over by the newsletter format (which is a real shame, but I'll leave that for another essay). This type of blog is the Insightful Essayer (Paul Graham, Morgan Housel, Julia Evans). Instead of posting sporadic links and quick comments on various things, the Insightful Essayer usually spends more time on a post, and the outline follows that of a traditional essay with an introduction, examples, and a conclusion.

It's not necessary to pick one of the styles and follow it forever. Some blogs vary between the two often. But, it *is* important to decide which style you *want* to have because the style should influence the design.

If you want to blog in the more traditional style of sporadic posting, your blog probably needs to be reverse chronological with pagination. Instead of having an index with links about who you are and what you do, the index is just a list of your first five posts.

However, if you want to be categorized as an Insightful Essayer, your index would most likely give a blurb about who you are, what you do, and what you write about followed by a list of your most recent posts and/or a list of your most popular posts. The reverse chronological layout is not conducive for irregular posting, because if you go two months without posting an essay, your site looks dormant. But, if you have a list of posts, it communicates semi-regular updating.

I've gone and forth on this a lot over the last few years, as I've probably spent too much time debating how my site looks and how it functions. But it's important for me to spend time building something that will ideally last forever and will be somewhat simple to use.

Although I like the idea of having a more traditional style of blog, I do think it can be easy to post short commentaries on essays or videos and feel like I've "written" for the day, when in reality, I haven't. Doing that over time clutters my site not with unique ideas about the world, but half-assed "thoughts" about *other* people's ideas.

For me, the site layouts also meant different ways of posting. Since the reverse chronological style required more frequent posting, I wanted to make it easy to actually post. So, I built the backend in WordPress and used it as a Headless CMS. This made posting easier. However, I realized it diluted my ideas. It was almost *too* easy to post something new, so I would just post something new. But as I did that, and compared my site to others I admired, I realized I want my personal site not to be a compendium of other people's ideas and thoughts about them, but unique ideas that *I* had about the world.
