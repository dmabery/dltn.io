Back when the quickest way to transport horses from one place to another was by boat, ship captains had to beware. Transporting inanimate objects was simple: you load the cargo on the ship, sail to your destination, and unload.

But when the objects were animate, it was a different story.

When horses were stored in the bottom of a ship's cargo hold, the slightest wake from a passing ship or an unexpected wave could send the army of galloping creatures into a frenzy.

A wake could bring the port side of the ship down, startling the horses on that side. In response, they'd take a big step back, trying to balance themselves out. This sudden movement startled the horses on the starboard side, causing them to balance themselves out, which once again startled the horses on the port side.

This continuous back-and-forth was called a "horse storm," and it would cause a ship to rock back and forth violently. Though it never managed to capsize a ship, it could damage a dock or the side of a ship if a horse storm happened in port.

Humans are the same way.

When something unexpected happens, our reactions can often make the situation worse. When the situation gets worse, we respond poorly again, making a not so bad situation into an absolutely terrible one.

Before you react to unexpected news, let the ship settle.

Don't create a horse storm.
