# The key to learning well, after you've created the discipline to study, is to ask the right questions

"Once you have learned to ask questions â€“ relevant and appropriate and substantial questions â€“ you have learned how to learn and no one can keep you from learning whatever you want or need to know." - [[Neal Postman]]
