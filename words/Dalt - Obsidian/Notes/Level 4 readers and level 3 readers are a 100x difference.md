# Level 4 readers and level 3 readers are a 100x difference
From [[Tim Urban]] that if 2% of your readers are a level 4, meaning they are huge fans and evangelists compared to 20% of your readers at level 4 is a dramatic difference in virality.

And the difference between a level 3 reader and a level 4 reader is huge. A level 3 reader might like your posts and open every few emails they get. But a level 4 reader will open every email and send the article to 4 people that they think will love it, every time.

Not every reader can be a level 4 reader, and even trying to achieve that is nonsense. Some people won't like your work and that's okay [[When a critic says they don't like something, they're right. When they tell you how to fix ti, they're wrong.]]
