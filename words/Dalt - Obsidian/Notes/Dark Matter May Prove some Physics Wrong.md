> The results from [a new study](https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access%3Ddoi%26doi%3D10.1051/0004-6361/202141822&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1644964020452353&usg=AOvVaw0HfN0xxdY2eMDMPVEeJ1Tb) in the journal _Astronomy & Astrophysics_ suggest that dark matter, an unidentified yet abundant substance in the universe, might be directly interacting with the regular “baryonic” matter that makes up stars, planets, and our bodies. This finding directly conflicts with a well-corroborated theory called the Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, or the standard model of cosmology, which predicts that dark matter particles do not interact with regular particles, except as a gravitational influence.
