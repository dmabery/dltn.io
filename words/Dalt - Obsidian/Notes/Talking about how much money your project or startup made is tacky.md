The title says it all.

I see so many people, who are instantly blocked, on Twitter share screenshots of how much money they make, or joke about how they're little "internet project" now makes 1M ARR.

It's annoying and tacky. No one worth working with sees that and goes, "That's respectable. I want to work with that person."
