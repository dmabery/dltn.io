## Script

This is Sidney Gottlieb, a crazy chemist who lead the secret CIA program, MKUltra. Its aim was to test drugs like LSD and other procedures like sensory deprivation and electroshock in an effort to destroy and reprogram the human mind, which is also more casually known, also known as Mind Control.

At the time, the US Government believed the Soviets had successfully achieved mind control on US prisoners of war during the Korean War and had to develop the same. So, they looked to people who had done this sort of thing before - Nazi doctors. In fact, the CIA recruited many Nazi doctors to Fort Detrick to continue this process.

The project began in April 1953 where they started to give LSD to mental patients, prisoners, and other people "who could not fight back." Often, this was given without prior knowledge or the patients consent. In one prisoner, they gave him LSD for 174 straight days.

Another operation within MKUltra was called Midnight Climax. The goal here was to give people inside of brothels LSD before the sessions and observed what happened through one-way-mirrors.

After Watergate, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered the destruction of all MKUltra documents, so there is still a lot we don't know. Most of what we do know, we give thanks to testimonies from people like Frank Olson's family and a box of financial documents someone misplaced - perhaps someone who wanted them to be found.
