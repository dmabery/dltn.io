# You should be learning continuously and discretely

### As a creator...
You want to be writing or creating discretely, big, polished pieces of work every so often.

You also want to be creating continuously, these are less polished ideas/content but more frequent and top of mind for someone.

### As a learner...
You want to be consuming big, finished works from people. There are books, courses, blog post guides, etc. [[The Story of Civilization]] and [[Memoirs of the Second World War]]

You also want to be learning continuously. This means consuming smaller, bite sized tweets, notes, and blog posts from creators reporting on new ideas or topics.

### Note...
When I say "creator", that isn't just applicable to people who create content publicly. If you're a learner and take notes on what you learn, you should be collecting bite sized continuous notes and discrete, go-to guides or resources for your study.
