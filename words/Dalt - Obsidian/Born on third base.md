A saying I just heard, but immediately fell in love with:

> Here's a guy who was born on third base and thought he hit a triple.

It reminds me of how, contrary to what we think we reward, we rarely reward good decision making, we reward good outcomes. If a decision is made with sound logic and information, but is an utter failure, was it ever a good decision? Meanwhile if a decision was made on a whim without much forethought, and has an incredible outcome, was it a good decision?
