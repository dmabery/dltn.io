A - Working Notes on the Dirac Equation

1
- In these notes I thought it would be fun to present the Dirac equation in the form of what I call [discovery fiction](https://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics/). As I say at that link: "Discovery fiction starts with the question `how would I have discovered this result?' And then you try to make up a story about how you might have come to discover it, following simple, almost-obvious steps." Of course, for something like the Dirac equation this typically requires some considerable background (or the discovery fiction gets very long). In this case, I'll assume you're comfortable with basic non-relativistic quantum mechanics. I'll also use a little quantum information at one point.
