- Because in most fields, there is a correlation between effort and results. Use the example of, they’re stories about Tiger Woods where he used to go to the range and hit a 1000 golf balls, or basketball players that will go to the gym and just dribble all day long without ever shooting the ball, just incredible amount of effort that leads to incredible results. And which is how most fields work. I just don’t think there’s any evidence that in investing, on average, the harder you try, the better you’ll do. It’s not one of those fields. And so that’s why people want to make it complicated, because they intuitively think that if they make it more complicated, they’ll do better.
  And I think the evidence is actually the opposite. That if you fiddle with fewer knobs, make fewer decisions, you just make it more simple that you will, on average, do much better over time. And it’s not for everyone, even if they understand that it’s just not in their personality to actually implement it in real life. They want to always be taking action with this idea that their actions will be lead to better results. So that’s something that’s obvious in the world that is never noticed. It’s not taken seriously.
