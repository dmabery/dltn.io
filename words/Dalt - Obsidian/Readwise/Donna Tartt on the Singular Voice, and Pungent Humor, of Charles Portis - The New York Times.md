A - Donna Tartt on the Singular Voice, and Pungent Humor, of Charles Portis - The New York Times

1
- It is likely no surprise to readers who love the novels of Charles Portis that everything delightful about his books was delightful about him as a person. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybmfe4ccn3x514sxwcg55n9))

- Pick up any novel by Portis and open it to any page and you will find something so devastatingly strange and fresh and hilarious that you will want to run into the next room and read it aloud to somebody. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybmjs2rydbh47zxg0kshkyg))

    - Note: as are those where you can’t possibly try to keep the whole of its existence - the message, the dialogue, the questions - in your head at once. without going mad, that it.

- Though it’s often said of Portis that he’s the least known of great American novelists, I cannot think of another 20th-century writer — *any* writer, American or otherwise — whose works are beloved among quite so many differing age groups and literary tastes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybmtkc51pdf2nz6d8r2n2fp))

- People liked to use the word “recluse,” which, I suspected, spoke less to an abnormal way of life than to an ex-newspaperman’s natural distrust of the press. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gybmy6qny7svp7ehwn77rhh6))

- We corresponded after that, and spoke on the telephone — my thought being that if he welcomed annoyance callers so warmly, he might not mind sometimes hearing from me. He was modest about his achievements and uninterested in talking about his life as a novelist or indeed about novels, period; though the diction of his books — effortless as birdsong — pervaded his every spoken sentence, from his conversation one would never suspect that he’d written a novel at all, much less several great ones.
