A - The Unified Content Business Model

1
- First and foremost that means publishers need to answer the most fundamental question required of any enterprise: are they a niche or scale business?
  • Niche businesses make money by maximizing revenue per user on a (relatively) small user base
  • Scale businesses make money by maximizing the number of users they reach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzf205sfep93se7hjzr4jsqb))

- In this world the only scarce resource is attention: even if a user is “second-screening” — on their phone while watching TV, for example — they are only ever paying attention to one piece of content at any given moment. It follows, then, that value is a function of attention, because value is always downstream from scarcity.
  This has further implications for content companies: to maximize leverage on their costs content companies must have well-considered funnels for acquiring customers and monetizing them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzf2bpkb9e72t400q10jek0w))

- I think that Substack is making a mistake in not doing the same thing for writing: it’s simply not viable for one-person or small-team publishers to sell ads effectively; Substack, though, has aggregated a whole slew of them, and thus is uniquely positioned to create value for its writers collectively by building out an ad product. This, by extension, could help Substack authors with their own hole in the funnel: moving readers from links in tweets to paying subscribers would be easier if there were a money-making layer in the middle.

- The right place to draw the line will and should differ based on whether a product is niche or scaled, and on the cost structure of the content producer; what seems less necessary, given the need to both leverage content costs and acquire customers effectively, is being religious about only making money in one specific way.
