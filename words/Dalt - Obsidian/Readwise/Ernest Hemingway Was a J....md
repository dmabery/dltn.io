- He used a technique he coined called 'The Iceberg Theory.' 
  Here‚Äôs how it goes:

- He was never alone, but he was lonely.
  ‚ÄúWriting, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates."
