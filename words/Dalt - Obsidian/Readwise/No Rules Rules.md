B - No Rules Rules

1
- “loss aversion.” We humans hate to lose what we already have, even more than we like getting something new. Faced with losing something, we will do everything we can to avoid losing it. We take that vacation. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=126))
1
- Most interesting of all, unlike the vast majority of firms that fail when the industry shifts, Netflix had responded successfully to four massive transitions in the entertainment and business environment in just fifteen years: From DVD by mail to streaming old TV series and movies over the internet. From streaming old content to launching new original content (such as House of Cards) produced by external studios. From licensing content provided by external studios to building their own in-house studio that creates award-winning TV shows and movies (such as Stranger Things, La Casa De Papel, and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs). From a USA-only company to a global company entertaining people in 190 countries. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=151))
1
- Policies and control processes became so foundational to our work that those who were great at coloring within the lines were promoted, while many creative mavericks felt stifled and went to work elsewhere. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=176))
1
- Through a gradual evolution, over many years of trial and error, we found an approach for making this work. If you give employees more freedom instead of developing processes to prevent them from exercising their own judgment, they will make better decisions and it’s easier to hold them accountable. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=185))
1
- Best of all, once you start developing this type of culture, a virtuous cycle kicks in. Removing controls creates a culture of “Freedom and Responsibility” (a term Netflix employees use so much that they now just say “F&R”), which attracts top talent and makes possible even fewer controls. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=202))
1
- In his famous commencement speech at Stanford University, Steve Jobs said: “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=240))
1
- If your business model depends on inducing feelings of stupidity in your customer base, you can hardly expect to build much loyalty. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=276))

- TALENT DENSITY: TALENTED PEOPLE MAKE ONE ANOTHER MORE EFFECTIVE ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=336))
1
- In hindsight, I understood that a team with one or two merely adequate performers brings down the performance of everyone on the team. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=345))
1
- If you have a team of five stunning employees and two adequate ones, the adequate ones will sap managers’ energy, so they have less time for the top performers, reduce the quality of group discussions, lowering the team’s overall IQ, force others to develop ways to work around them, reducing efficiency, drive staff who seek excellence to quit, and show the team you accept mediocrity, thus multiplying the problem. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=346))
1
- Felps first found that, even when other team members were exceptionally talented and intelligent, one individual’s bad behavior brought down the effectiveness of the entire team. In dozens of trials, conducted over month-long periods, groups with one underperformer did worse than other teams by a whopping 30 to 40 percent. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=364))
1
- If you have a group with a few merely adequate performers, that performance is likely to spread, bringing down the performance of the entire organization. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=375))
1
- THE FIRST DOT This is the most critical dot for the foundation of the whole Netflix story. A fast and innovative workplace is made up of what we call “stunning colleagues”—highly talented people, of diverse backgrounds and perspectives, who are exceptionally creative, accomplish significant amounts of important work, and collaborate effectively. What’s more, none of the other principles can work unless you have ensured this first dot is in place. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=392))
1
- I tried to take this same commitment to being honest back to the office. I began encouraging everyone to say exactly what they really thought, but with positive intent—not to attack or injure anyone, but to get feelings, opinions, and feedback out onto the table, where they could be dealt with. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=430))
1
- I saw that openly voicing opinions and feedback, instead of whispering behind one another’s backs, reduced the backstabbing and politics and allowed us to be faster. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=446))
1
- That’s when we coined the expression “Only say about someone what you will say to their face.” ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=448))
1
- HIGH PERFORMANCE + SELFLESS CANDOR = EXTREMELY HIGH PERFORMANCE ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=476))
1
- At Netflix, it is tantamount to being disloyal to the company if you fail to speak up when you disagree with a colleague or have feedback that could be helpful. After all, you could help the business—but you are choosing not to. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=494))
1
- Your brain responds to negative feedback with the same fight-or-flight reactions of a physical threat, releasing hormones into the bloodstream, quickening reaction time, and heightening emotions. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=530))
1
- Most people intuitively understand that a simple feedback loop can help them get better at their jobs. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=549))
1
- But they did. Studies showed that drivers slowed down 14 percent—at three schools, the average speed fell below the posted speed limit. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=558))
1
- A feedback loop is one of the most effective tools for improving performance. We learn faster and accomplish more when we make giving and receiving feedback a continuous part of how we collaborate. Feedback helps us to avoid misunderstandings, creates a climate of co-accountability, and reduces the need for hierarchy and rules. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=560))
1
- When considering whether to give feedback, people often feel torn between two competing issues: they don’t want to hurt the recipient’s feelings, yet they want to help that person succeed. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=565))
1
- I recommend instead focusing first on something much more difficult: getting employees to give candid feedback to the boss. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=570))
1
- No one dared point out the obvious—except for a child with no understanding of hierarchy, power, or consequences. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=575))

    - Note: This could be a blog post
1
- employees to give them honest feedback is regularly putting feedback on the agenda of their one-on-one meetings with their staff. Don’t ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=579))
1
- You must show the employee that it’s safe to give feedback by responding to all criticism with gratitude and, above all, by providing “belonging cues.” As Daniel Coyle, author of The Culture Code, describes them, such cues are gestures that indicate “your feedback makes you a more important member of this tribe” or “you were candid with me and that in no way puts your job or our relationship in danger; you belong here.” ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=584))
1
- Coyle explains that the function of a belonging cue “is to answer the ancient ever-present question glowing in our brains: Are we safe here? What’s our future with these people? Are there dangers lurking?” The more you and others in your company respond to all candid moments with belonging cues, the more courageous people will be in their candor. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=591))

- “Brian, the day you find yourself sitting on your feedback because you’re worried you’ll be unpopular is the day you’ll need to leave Netflix. We hire you for your opinions. Every person in that room is responsible for telling me frankly what they think.” ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=620))
1
- A climate of candor doesn’t mean anything goes. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=673))
1
- 4A FEEDBACK GUIDELINES ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=679))
1
- “The way you pick your teeth in meetings with external partners is irritating” is wrong feedback. Right feedback would be, “If you stop picking your teeth in external partner meetings, the partners are more likely to see you as professional, and we’re more likely to build a strong relationship.” ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=683))
1
- Your feedback must focus on what the recipient can do differently. Wrong feedback to me in Cuba would have been to stop at the comment, “Your presentation is undermining its own messages.” Right feedback was, “The way you ask the audience for input is resulting in only Americans participating.” Even better would have been: “If you can find a way to solicit contributions from other nationalities in the room your presentation will be more powerful.” ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=686))

- PREACH FEEDBACK ANYWHERE, ANYTIME ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=707))

- Then Rose’s close colleague Bianca waved her arm from the back of the room, offering a life vest . . . Netflix style: “Rose! This isn’t working! You are losing the room! You sound defensive! You’re talking too fast. You’re not listening to the questions. You’re repeating yourself without addressing the concerns. Take a deep breath. You NEED THE ROOM,” she called out: ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=723))

- CLARIFY AND REINFORCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING SELFLESSLY CANDID AND A BRILLIANT JERK ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=738))
1
- But it doesn’t matter how brilliant your jerk is, if you keep him on the team you can’t benefit from candor. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=745))
1
- A culture of candor does not mean that you can speak your mind without concern for how it will impact others. On the contrary, it requires that everyone think carefully about the 4A guidelines. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=755))
1
- If you have a group of people who are highly talented, thoughtful, and well-meaning, you can ask them to do something that is not at all natural but nonetheless incredibly helpful to a company’s speed and effectiveness. You can ask them to give each other loads of candid feedback and challenge authority. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=779))
1
- TAKEAWAYS FROM CHAPTER 2 With candor, high performers become outstanding performers. Frequent candid feedback exponentially magnifies the speed and effectiveness of your team or workforce. Set the stage for candor by building feedback moments into your regular meetings. Coach your employees to give and receive feedback effectively, following the 4A guidelines. As the leader, solicit feedback frequently and respond with belonging cues when you receive it. Get rid of jerks as you instill a culture of candor. ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=782))

- Today, in the information age, what matters is what you achieve, not how many hours you clock, especially for the employees of creative companies like Netflix. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=808))
1
- If you are working all the time, you don’t have the perspective to see your problem with fresh eyes. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=839))
1
- In the absence of a policy, the amount of vacation people take largely reflects what they see their boss and colleagues taking. Which is why, if you want to remove your vacation policy, start by getting all leaders to take significant amounts of vacation and talk a lot about it. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=863))
1
- With the absence of a policy, most people look around their department to understand the “soft limits” of what’s acceptable. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=869))
1
- “The Netflix culture has great ideals but sometimes the gap between the ideals and practice is big, and what should bridge that gap is leadership. When leaders don’t set a good example . . . I guess I’m what happens.” ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=893))
1
- “What we say as leaders is only half the equation,” Greg explains. “Our employees are also looking at what we do. If I say, ‘I want you to find a sustainable and healthy work-life balance,’ but I’m in the office twelve hours a day, people will imitate my actions, not follow my words.” ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=900))

- In Japan, businesspeople are famous for long work hours and taking little time off. There are stories of people working so much there, they literally die from it. There’s even a word for this phenomenon, karoshi. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=917))
1
- Greg, an American, managed to get an entire office of Japanese people to work and vacation like Europeans. He didn’t create rules or nag. He just modeled the behavior and communicated expectations. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=926))

- SET AND REINFORCE CONTEXT TO GUIDE EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOR ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=937))
1
- In the absence of written policy, every manager must spend time speaking to the team about what behaviors fall within the realm of the acceptable and appropriate. ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=954))
1
- As a company grows, the variety in how leaders set context and model behavior increases. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=960))

- GIVE FREEDOM TO GET RESPONSIBILITY ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1005))
1
- Because of our high-talent density, our employees were already conscientious and responsible. Because of our culture of candor, if anyone abused the system or took advantage of the freedom allotted, others would call them out directly and explain the undesirable impact of their actions. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1009))
1
- Freedom is not the opposite of accountability, as I’d previously considered. Instead, it is a path toward ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1015))
1
- We had proved that with the right employees, clear modeling from management, and enough context setting, we could get along perfectly fine without a bunch of rules. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1038))
1
- Well, that seemed reasonable. It only served to underline why setting rules and policies can never work well. Real life is so much more nuanced than any policy could ever address. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1047))

- SPEND COMPANY MONEY AS IF IT WERE YOUR OWN ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1051))

- Today the entirety of the travel and expense policy still consists of these five simple words: ACT IN NETFLIX’S BEST INTEREST ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1067))
1
- That works better. It is not in Netflix’s best interest that the entire content team fly business from L.A. to Mexico. But if you have to take the red-eye from L.A. to New York and give a presentation the next morning it would likely be in Netflix’s best interest that you fly business, so you don’t have bags under your eyes and slurred speech when the big moment arises. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1069))
1
- SET CONTEXT UP FRONT AND KEEP AN EYE ON SPENDING OUT BACK ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1089))
1
- This is the nub of F&R. If your people choose to abuse the freedom you give them, you need to fire them and fire them loudly, so others understand the ramifications. Without this, freedom doesn’t work. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1130))
1
- But this is the most important message of this chapter: even if your employees spend a little more when you give them freedom, the cost is still less than having a workplace where they can’t fly. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1164))

- Netflix had invested a big chunk of money so that our customers could watch House of Cards on new 4K ultra high definition TVs. The problem was that until this moment basically no TVs supported 4K. We had this fresh super-crisp look, but few could see it. Now, our partner Samsung had come out with the only 4K television so far on the market. These TVs were expensive, and it wasn’t clear if customers would buy them. My big goal that year was to work with Samsung to get lots of people watching House of Cards in 4K. We had a minor media coup when journalist Geoffrey Fowler, who reviews high-tech products for the Washington Post and has about two million readers, agreed to test House of Cards on Samsung’s new TV. His review would need to be great for 4K to take off. On Thursday Samsung engineers had come to Netflix with the 4K TV and checked it with my engineers to make sure Mr. Fowler would have a terrific viewing experience. Thursday evening, the TV tested, we all went home. But Friday morning, when I arrived at the office, the TV was gone. After checking with facilities, I realized it had been disposed of with a bunch of old TVs we’d told them to get rid of. This was serious. That TV was due in Fowler’s living room in two hours. It was too late to call the Samsung people. We’d have to buy another TV before ten a.m. I started calling every electronic store in town. The first three calls resulted in: “I’m sorry sir, we don’t have that TV.” My heart was pounding in my throat. We were going to miss the deadline. I was almost in tears when Nick, the most junior engineer on our team, sprinted into the office. “Don’t worry, Nigel,” Nick said. “I solved that. I came in last night, and I saw the TV had been disposed of. You didn’t respond to my calls and texts. So I drove out to the Best Buy in Tracy, bought the same TV, and tested it this morning. It cost twenty-five hundred dollars, but I thought it was the right thing to do.” I was floored. Two and a half thousand dollars! Imagine, a junior engineer feeling so empowered that he spends that much without approval because he thinks it’s the right decision. I felt a wave of relief. Due to all the sign-off policies this could never have happened at Microsoft, HP, or any other company I have worked for.” In the end, Fowler loved the high-definition ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1172))

- I don’t want rules that prevent employees from making good decisions in a timely way. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1192))
1
- Processes provide management with a sense of control, but they slow everything way down. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1210))
1
- From Nigel’s and Jennifer’s examples, we see how a simple expense guideline like “act in the company’s best interest” gives your employees both freedom of choice and the ability to move fast. But freedom and speed aren’t the only benefits. A third, and more surprising benefit, is that some employees actually spend less when the expense policy is lifted. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1216))
1
- Once you have a workforce made up nearly exclusively of high performers, you can count on people to behave responsibly. Once you have developed a culture of candor, employees will watch out for one another and ensure their teammates’ actions are in line with the good of the company. Then you can begin to remove controls and give your staff more freedom. Great places to start are the lifting of your vacation, travel, and expense policies. These elements give people more control over their own lives and convey a loud message that you trust your employees to do what’s right. The trust you offer will in turn instill feelings of responsibility in your workforce, leading everyone in the company to have a greater sense of ownership. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1238))

- TAKEAWAYS FROM CHAPTER 3A (VACATION) When removing your vacation policy, explain that there is no need to ask for prior approval and that neither the employees themselves nor their managers are expected to keep track of their days away from the office. It is left to the employee alone to decide if and when he or she feels like taking a few hours, a day, a week, or a month off work. When you remove the vacation policy, it will leave a hole. What fills the hole is the context the boss provides for the team. Copious discussions must take place, setting the scene for how employees should approach vacation decisions. The practices modeled by the boss will be critical to guide employees as to the appropriate behavior. An office with no vacation policy but a boss who never vacations will result in an office that never vacations. ▶ TAKEAWAYS FROM CHAPTER 3B (TRAVEL AND EXPENSE) When removing travel and expense policies, encourage managers to set context about how to spend money up front and to check employee receipts at the back end. If people overspend, set more context. With no expense controls, you’ll need your finance department to audit a portion of receipts annually. When you find people abusing the system, fire them and speak about the abuse openly—even when they are star performers in other ways. This is necessary so that others understand the ramifications of behaving irresponsibly. Some expenses may increase with freedom. But the costs from overspending are not nearly as high as the gains that freedom provides. With expense freedom, employees will be able to make quick decisions to spend money in ways that help the business. Without the time and administrative costs associated with purchase orders and procurement processes, you will waste fewer resources. Many employees will respond to their new freedom by spending less than they would in a system with rules. When you tell people you trust them, they will show you how trustworthy they are.

- We decided that rather than putting more rules and procedures in place, we would continue to do two other things: 1. We would find new ways to increase talent density. In order to attract and retain the best people, we would have to make sure that we offered the most attractive methods of compensation. 2. We would find new ways to increase candor. If we were going to remove controls, we would need to make sure that our employees had all the information they needed to make good decisions without management oversight. This would require increasing organizational transparency and eliminating company secrets. If we wanted employees to make good decisions for themselves, they would have to understand as much about what was going on in the business as those at the top. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1282))
1
- This finding makes perfect sense. Creative work requires that your mind feel a level of freedom. If part of what you focus on is whether or not your performance will get you that big check, you are not in that open cognitive space where the best ideas and most innovative possibilities reside. ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1442))
1
- Big salaries, not merit bonuses, are good for innovation. ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1446))
1
- Netflix, on the other hand, wants to pay what will attract and keep talent, so their conversation with employees is focused on making it clear that (a) they estimate well what their prospective employee could make at any other company and (b) they’ll be paying just above that. ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1483))
1
- The answer to this question is that when it comes to review time, instead of looking at what that employee is worth on the market, most companies use “raise pools” and “salary bands” to determine raises. ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1520))

- You’ll get more money if you change companies than if you stay put. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1532))
1
- To retain your top employees, it’s always better to give them the raise before they get the offers. ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1658))
1
- In order to fortify the talent density in your workforce, for all creative roles hire one exceptional employee instead of ten or more average ones. ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1672))
1
- The methods used by most companies to compensate employees are not ideal for a creative, high-talent-density workforce. Divide your workforce into creative and operational employees. Pay the creative workers top of market. This may mean hiring one exceptional individual instead of ten or more adequate people. Don’t pay performance-based bonuses. Put these resources into salary instead. Teach employees to develop their networks and to invest time in getting to know their own—and their teams’—market value on an ongoing basis. This might mean taking calls from recruiters or even going to interviews at other companies. Adjust salaries accordingly.

- Big things, small things, whether good or bad—if your first instinct is to put most information out there, others will do the same. At Netflix, we call this “sunshining,” and we make an effort to do a lot of it. ([Location 1757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1757))

- If a manager doesn’t know how many customers the company has signed on in the past weeks and months, and what strategy discussions are in the works, how does he know how many people he can afford to hire? He has to ask his boss. If his boss doesn’t know the details of the company’s growth, she can’t make a good decision either, so she has to go to her own boss. The more employees at all levels understand the strategy, financial situation, and the day-to-day context of what’s going on, the better they become at making educated decisions without involving those above them in the hierarchy.

- Answer from Reed: leave the spin in the gym •   •   • My response to Quiz Scenario 3 is (a): tell the whole truth. Manipulating your message to make the organization, yourself, or another employee appear better than reality is so common across the business world that many leaders don’t even realize they’re doing it. We “spin” by selectively sharing the facts, overemphasizing the positive, minimizing the negative, all in an attempt to shape the perception of others.

- Spinning the truth is one of the most common ways leaders erode trust. I can’t say this clearly enough: don’t do this. Your people are not stupid.

- When it comes to personal struggles, an individual’s right to privacy trumps an organization’s desire for transparency. Here we didn’t take the most transparent route. But we didn’t spin either.

- When you combine the data with Reed’s advice, this is the takeaway: a leader who has demonstrated competence and is liked by her team will build trust and prompt risk-taking when she widely sunshines her own mistakes. Her company benefits. The one exception is for a leader considered unproven or untrusted. In these cases you’ll want to build trust in your competency before shouting your mistakes.

- TAKEAWAYS FROM CHAPTER 5 To instigate a culture of transparency, consider what symbolic messages you send. Get rid of closed offices, assistants who act as guards, and locked spaces. Open up the books to your employees. Teach them how to read the P&L. Share sensitive financial and strategic information with everyone in the company. When making decisions that will impact your employees’ well-being, like reorganizations or layoffs, open up to the workforce early, before things are solidified. This will cause some anxiety and distraction, but the trust you build will outweigh the disadvantages. When transparency is in tension with an individual’s privacy, follow this guideline: If the information is about something that happened at work, choose transparency and speak candidly about the incident. If the information is about an employee’s personal life, tell people it’s not your place to share and they can ask the person concerned directly if they choose. As long as you’ve already shown yourself to be competent, talking openly and extensively about your own mistakes—and encouraging all your leaders to do the same—will increase trust, goodwill, and innovation throughout the organization.

- Coach your staff to challenge their managers exactly like Sheila did: “I know you disagree, but I’m going to follow this new idea because I think it will lead to greater gains. Let me know if you want to specifically override my decision.” At the same time, teach your leaders not to override decisions like Sheila’s, even in the face of their own skepticism and long experience of what has worked in the past.

- TAKEAWAYS FROM CHAPTER 6 In a fast and innovative company, ownership of critical, big-ticket decisions should be dispersed across the workforce at all different levels, not allocated according to hierarchical status. In order for this to work the leader must teach her staff the Netflix principle, “Don’t seek to please your boss.” When new employees join the company, tell them they have a handful of metaphorical chips that they can make bets with. Some gambles will succeed, and some will fail. A worker’s performance will be judged on the collective outcome of his bets, not on the results from one single instance. To help your workforce make good bets, encourage them to farm for dissent, socialize the idea, and for big bets, test it out. Teach your employees that when a bet fails, they should sunshine it openly. ([Location 2594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=2594))

- If we are going to be a championship team, then we want the best performer possible in every position. The old notion is that an employee has to do something wrong, or be inadequate, to lose their job.

- In order to encourage your managers to be tough on performance, teach them to use the Keeper Test: “Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at another company, would I fight hard to keep?” Avoid stack-ranking systems, as they create internal competition and discourage collaboration. For a high-performance culture, a professional sports team is a better metaphor than a family. Coach your managers to create strong feelings of commitment, cohesion, and camaraderie on the team, while continually making tough decisions to ensure the best player is manning each post. When you realize you need to let someone go, instead of putting him on some type of PIP, which is humiliating and organizationally costly, take all that money and give it to the employee in the form of a generous severance payment. The downside to a high-performance culture is the fear employees may feel that their jobs are on the line. To reduce fear, encourage employees to use the Keeper Test Prompt with their managers: “How hard would you work to change my mind if I were thinking of leaving?” When an employee is let go, speak openly about what happened with your staff and answer their questions candidly. This will diminish their fear of being next and increase their trust in the company and its managers. ([Location 2935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=2935))
