- Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously lowered by such experiences. Try making your customer service not merely good, but [surprisingly good](http://www.diaryofawebsite.com/blog/2008/07/wufoo-and-the-art-of-customer-service/). Go out of your way to make people happy.

- I learned this one from Joe Kraus. [[3](http://paulgraham.com/13sentences.html#f3n)] Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users. You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down.

- Even if you get demoralized, [don't give up](http://paulgraham.com/die.html). You can get surprisingly far by just not giving up. This isn't true in all fields. There are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no matter how long they persisted. But startups aren't like that.

- Understand your users. That's the key. The essential task in a startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most control over is how much you improve users' lives; and the hardest part of that is knowing what to make for them.
