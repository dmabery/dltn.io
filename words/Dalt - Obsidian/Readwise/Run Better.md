A - Run Better

1
- In practice: 
  I run 3 days per week, for 45-90 minutes. While running I donâ€™t let my heart rate go above 155 or below 145. This creates a safe zone for my heart and lungs to work. During this repetitive motion, my lungs and heart will optimize for this level of activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnrpq1fwk3nhq1sx0by9rs47))
