A - The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge

1
- The world has always been a sorry and confused sort of place—yet poets and artists and scientists have ignored the factors that would, if attended to, paralyze them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdkww0zrnr5pk7bbg0q0ejz))

- From a practical point of view, intellectual and spiritual life is, on the surface, a useless form of activity, in which men indulge because they procure for themselves greater satisfactions than are otherwise obtainable.

    - Note: Why I like to read, why I want to go back to school: because I want to procure for myself (and my family) greater satisfactions that are otherwise unobtainable.

- extent to which the pursuit of these useless satisfactions proves unexpectedly the source from which undreamed-of utility is derived. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdkz8t93yv3wwbeqbyeewvq))

    - Note: in this paper: Flexner seeks to show how these "useless" activities are actually the foundations of "undreamed-of utility"

- I ventured to ask him whom he regarded as the most useful worker in science in the world. He replied instantaneously: “Marconi.” I surprised him by saying, “Whatever pleasure we derive from the radio or however wireless and the radio may have added to human life, Marconi’s share was practically negligible.”
  I shall not forget his astonishment on this occasion. He asked me to explain. I replied to him somewhat as follows: “Mr. Eastman, Marconi was inevitable. The real credit for everything that has been done in the field of wireless belongs, as far as such fundamental credit can be definitely assigned to anyone, to Professor Clerk Maxwell, who in 1865 carried out certain abstruse and remote calculations in the field of magnetism and electricity.

    - Note: The person who creates the invention of something practical from a scientific theory is inevitable; if A didn't do it, B would have, if not B, then Z.
      Instead, the person who should be given the most credit is one who establishes the truth and existence of the scientific theory, for that person is not inevitable. If Maxwell didn't play with this little toys to figure out the ether, who else might have?

- Neither Maxwell nor Hertz had any concern about the utility of their work; no such thought ever entered their minds. They had no practical objective. The inventor in the legal sense was of course Marconi, but what did Marconi invent? Merely the last technical detail, mainly the now obsolete receiving device called coherer, almost universally discarded.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdm7s87ekdrawj3p97195aq))

    - Note: "They had no practical objective."

- Not Marconi, but Clerk Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz. Hertz and Maxwell were geniuses without thought of use. Marconi was a clever inventor with no thought but use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdm8tvaftdkw6tg09p2wveh))

- but one thing I said he could be sure of, namely, that they had done their work without thought of use and that throughout the whole history of science most of the really great discoveries which had ultimately proved to be beneficial to mankind had been made by men and women who were driven not by the desire to be useful but merely the desire to satisfy their curiosity.

- curiosity, which mayor may not eventuate in something useful, is probably the outstanding characteristic of modern thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdmagm1mytew7j753vm9d28))

- It is not new. It goes back to Galileo, Bacon, and to Sir Isaac Newton, and it must be absolutely unhampered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdman914yypws9btgsfc4ze))

- Institutions of learning should be devoted to the cultivation of curiosity and the less they are deflected by considerations of immediacy of application, the more likely they are to contribute not only to human welfare but to the equally important satisfaction of intellectual interest which may indeed be said to have become the ruling passion of intellectual life in modern times.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdmb80ad88n8y969emfny5s))

- The answer is interesting. Michael Faraday’s father was a blacksmith; Michael himself was apprenticed to a bookbinder. In 1812, when he was already twenty-one years of age, a friend took him to the Royal Institution where he heard Sir Humphrey Davy deliver four lectures on chemical subjects. He kept notes and sent a copy of them to Davy. The very next year, 1813, he became an assistant in Davy's laboratory, working on chemical problems.

- Pliny was killed by breathing sulphur dioxide in the eruption of Vesuvius almost two thousand years ago. Chlorine was not isolated by scientistsfor warlike purposes, and the same is true of mustard gas. These substances could be limited to beneficent use, but when the airplane was perfected, men whose hearts were poisoned and whose brains were addled perceived that the airplane, an innocent invention, the result of long disinterested and scientific effort, could be made an instrument of destruction, of which no one had ever dreamed and at which no one had ever deliberately aimed.

    - Note: Wilbur Wright has a great quote that reflects this thought.

- I noticed quite early that Ehrlich would work long hours at his desk, completely absorbed in microscopic observation. Moreover, his desk gradually became covered with colored spots of every description. As I saw him sitting at work one day, I went up to him and asked what he was doing with all hisrainbow array of colors on his table. Thereupon this young student in his first semester supposedly pursuing the regular course in anatomy looked up at me and blandly remarked, “*Ich probiere.*” This might be freely translated, “I am trying” or “I am just fooling.” I replied to him, “Very well. Go on with your fooling.” Soon I saw that without any teaching or direction whatsoever on my part I possessed in Ehrlich a student of unusual quality.

    - Note: "Ich probiere" - "I am just fooling" or "I am trying" - I love that. A good motto to have on my wall.

- Not a day passes but that in thousands of hospitals the world over Ehrlich's technic is employed in the examination of the blood. Thus the apparently aimless fooling in Waldeyer's dissecting room in Strasbourg has become a main factor in the daily practice of medicine.

- But what is infinitely more important is that we shall be striking the shackles off the human mind and setting it free for the adventures which in our own day have, on the one hand, taken Hale and Rutherford and Einstein and their peers millions upon millions of miles into the uttermost realms of space and, on the other, loosed the boundless energy imprisoned in the atom.

- this ultimate and unforeseen and unpredictable practical result is not offered as a justification for Rutherford or Einstein or Millikan or Bohr or any of their peers. Let them alone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdn0v3qvf1j5r84czv0cxtg))

- Thus it becomes obvious that one must be wary in attributing scientific discovery wholly to anyone person. Almost every discovery has a long and precarious history. Someone finds a bit here, another a bit there. A third step succeeds later and thus onward till a genius pieces the bits together and makes the decisive contribution.

- Science, like the Mississippi, begins in a tiny rivulet in the distant forest. Gradually other streams swell its volume. And the roaring river that bursts the dikes is formed from countless sources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdn4c6475k426j8s9sxfxch))

- I have spoken of experimental science; I have spoken of mathematics; but what I say is equally true ofmusic and art and of every other expression of the untrammeled human spirit. The mere fact that they bring satisfaction to an individual soul bent upon its own purification and elevation is all the justification that they need ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdn5t0ymngfb3e4bgkggj76))

- The subject which I am discussing has at this moment a peculiar poignancy. In certain large areas-Germany and Italy especially-the effort is now being made to clamp down the freedom of the human spirit. Universities have been so reorganized that they have become tools of those who believe in a special political, economic, or racial creed. Now and then a thoughtless individual in one of the few democracies left in this world will even question the fundamental importance of absolutely untrammeled academic freedom. The real enemy of the human race is not the fearless and irresponsible thinker, be he right or wrong. The real enemy is the man who tries to mold the human spirit so that it will not dare to spread its wings, as its wings were once spread in Italy and Germany, as well as in Great Britain and the United States.
