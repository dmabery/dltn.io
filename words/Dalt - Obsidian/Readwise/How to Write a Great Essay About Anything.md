A - How to Write a Great Essay About Anything

1
- Introduction
  1. Begin with a broad, conclusive hook. This will be the meta-theme of the paper. Example from a paper on *The Great Gatsby*: “When citizens exhibit a flagrant disregard of morality and law, societies quickly crumble.”
  2. Thesis. This needs to specify and codify the hook in relation to the prompt/subject. Ex: “This atmosphere as shown in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby — with blatant corruption and illegal activity — eventually seems to become all but incompatible with a meaningful incarnation of the American Dream.”
  3. One sentence laying foundation for first body paragraph. (These are mini-theses for each point you will argue.) Ex: Though Gatsby was a bootlegger, he was driven by hope and love, rather than the greed that motivated his status-obsessed guests.
  4. One Sentence for second body paragraph. (Just like the sentence you just did)
  5. One sentence for third body paragraph.
  6. Restate the hook and thesis into a single transition sentence into the first paragraph. “The 1920s as the epitome of excess and reactionism symbolized a sharp break in the American tradition; one that no one seemed to mind.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzf560j6ypytdeq7d011rm5f))

- Body #1

  2. Support the mini-thesis with evidence and analysis.

- Conclusion
  1. Restate hook/meta-theme.
  2. Specify this with restatement of thesis once more.
  3. One sentence for each body paragraph, surmising its assertion.
  4. One sentence for each body paragraph, surmising its assertion.
  5. One sentence for each body paragraph, surmising its assertion.
  6. Rewrite hook and thesis into a conclusion sentence.
  7. Last sentence must transition to a general statement about human nature. “The American Dream — and any higher aspiration — requires a society that both looks forward and onwards as well as holds itself to corrective standards.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzf579p9mvkh7ejs8e4r9s7g))
