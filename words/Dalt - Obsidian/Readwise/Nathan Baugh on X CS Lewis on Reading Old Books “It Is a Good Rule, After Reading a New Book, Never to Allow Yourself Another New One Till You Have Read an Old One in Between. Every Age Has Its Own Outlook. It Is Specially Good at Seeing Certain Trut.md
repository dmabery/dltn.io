- CS Lewis on reading old books: “It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between. Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And that means the old books.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h93zx8jwqskv7nwbwvwxww04))
