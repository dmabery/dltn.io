A - 3-2-1: The responsibility of any creator, leadership, and how to succeed

- **Charles Hayward,** a cabinet maker and editor of *The Woodworker* magazine, offers some advice on how to succeed in woodworking (and in life):
  "One thing is certain: that, even though the craft is a lifetime's study, the application of a few simple principles will assuredly bring success in woodworking. In the first place, never start a job until you know precisely how you are going to do it. Pass its construction step by step through your mind, so that you may hit upon the snags and mentally smooth them out.
  Don't work hurriedly. Your very keenness may prompt you to rush, but to do so is fatal. Curb your desire to see the thing finished, and always concentrate intently upon the particular bit of the job you have in hand.
  In all you do be accurate. No measurement, no cut, no squaring, should be "near enough." It must be right. For often one inaccuracy becomes the seed of others, and reproduces trouble as the work proceeds.
  Finally, don't worry about an honest mistake. Ponder the reason for it and so learn from it. Progress at your own speed from simple job to something more difficult, but never force the pace. At the same time, be just as ambitious as your previous work warrants." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpkr48wyt8f4g2bnfypqs43n))

- The greatest myth in management is that you can't manage what you don't measure. It's hot or cold outside regardless of how many digits of precision your thermometer is showing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h14h6pemj9p65wbrke5ds7rj))

- If you want more than this, you ought to embrace the paradox that there are times when the less you know raises the bar for what you can do. Don't drown out our inner drumbeat by living all your days inside the permanent intellectual festival of your profession. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3a2tfapnge88pbev3a2zzgs))

- Writer and Aikido teacher **George Leonard** on how to get started:
  "You can't do everything, but you can do one thing, and then another and another. In terms of energy, it's better to make a wrong choice than none at all. You might begin by listing your priorities—for the day, for the week, for the month, for a lifetime. Start modestly. List everything you want to do today or tomorrow. Set priorities by dividing the items into A, B, and C categories. At the least, accomplish the A items. Try the same thing with long-term goals. Priorities do shift, and you can change them at any time, but simply getting them down in black and white adds clarity to your life, and clarity creates energy."

- “The test of a business man is not whether he can make money in one or two boom years, or can make money through the luck of getting into the field first, but whether in a highly competitive field, without having any initial advantage over his competitors, he can outdistance them in a perfect honourable way and keep the respect of himself and of his community.”

- “Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.”

- For example, a kid trying to quickly answer a homework question without reading the textbook or an office worker trying to avoid reading a boring 200-page research report. Those are valid use cases, but not what we're building software for. Ultimately, we want to maximize quality time spent reading long-form documents, not substitute for it.
