A - A Theology of Communication – Religion Online

1
- Theology is a statement that tries to make sense out of our lives. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372485))
1
- Theology is a statement that tries to make sense out of our lives. Of course, there are more sophisticated views of theology. And there are many different kinds of theology: historical, systematic, practical, black, liberation -- in fact, a "theology of" just about every movement and topic that requires serious thought and signification.

1
- they are attempts to deal honestly and lucidly with the way things are, so as to help people understand what life is all about. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372512))

- Dulles is right in insisting that the church "cannot wall itself up in a cultural ghetto at a time when humanity as a whole is passing into the electronic age." (1). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372529))

- The dictionary tells us that communication is: first, the act of transmitting; second, facts or information transmitted; third, written information, conversation, or talk; fourth, access between persons or places; or fifth, interchange of thoughts or opinions.(2) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372534))
1
- I find more useful the following definition: communication is the process in which relationships are established, maintained, modified, or terminated through the increase or reduction of meaning. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372541))
1
- What we discover is that, reduced to the most basic level possible, there exist only three things: matter, energy, and relationships. And these relationships, whether between atoms and molecules, bees and flowers, or humans and God, are created, sustained, and modified by some kind of communication. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372551))
1
- It is significant that there is an increasing correspondence recently between Christian process theology and theories of communication. Process theology holds that things that endure are composed of a series or a process of distinct occasions or experience, each one connected to the next, and each one affecting the next. Nothing is independent and disconnected. All experience is related to previous experiences. Everything -- atoms, animals, human beings, nature and the universe -- is interrelated. And communication is the fundamental process by which these relationships occur. Communication is a fundamental given of existence, essential to the nature of being.

- Community, the fulfillment of effective human communication, is essential to our becoming human. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372567))
1
- The question of whether television creates values and attitudes, or merely reflects them, is strictly a diversion, since the media, of course, do both. They reflect the values in the culture, and they legitimate, circulate, and amplify them and thus, in reality, "create" them as potent values, through the process of resonance. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372599))
1
- Thus a non-Christian view of life predominates in mass media, as it does in the society as a whole. As Martin Marty has pointed out, the "proper" opinion always dominates, and the Christian view is always the "improper" opinion.14. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372604))
1
- There are several Christian doctrines, derived from the witness of Scripture, Christian tradition, and the reflection of Christians today, which bear directly on the role of communication in society. They are: creation and stewardship; sin and redemption; the newness of life; good news and proclamation; and Christian witness. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372608))
1
- . That God is creator of "all things visible and invisible" is a central Christian doctrine. By this is meant that all things are interrelated, that the eternal order of things is revealed in the historical order, and that we human beings are not the creators but rather are bound together as part of creation along with all other parts of creation, in mutuality. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372613))

- 2. Christians understand sin as the misuse of God’s gifts. Sin is taking something that is a gift of God -- things, money, power, prestige -- and treating it as if it were God. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372630))
1
- Humans constantly misuse the power over creation that God has given them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372633))
1
- Historically, Christianity has understood that a major role of government is the regulation of the misuse of power. A fundamental task of government is to protect the weak and defenseless against the powerful and the predator. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372643))
1
- Thus Christians recognize the necessity for governmental regulation of those aspects of communication which allow it to become a monopoly of the few at the expense of the many. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372653))
1
- Christian doctrine takes seriously the concept that God makes all things new, that novelty and creativity are essential elements of God`s world. Therefore, Christians resist any attempts to restrict communication so that persons are restricted in their choices. New ideas, new values, new understandings are essential to growth and to human potential ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372655))
1
- Any policy or regulation which would restrict opportunities for persons to discover new meanings is theologically unsupportable. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372658))
1
- Censorship of communication is itself a sin, since it allows one person or group to dominate the information intake of all others. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372660))
1
- It also rejects top-down, one-way flows of communication. It remains open, not only to novelty, but also to that which is not yet completely understood, since God works in mysterious ways, and can never be fully grasped, predicted, or controlled. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372663))
1
- Christians testify to the fact of the good news that Christ came to set us free, that is, to set persons free from personal sin, from corporate bondage, and from all kinds of oppression -- spiritual, mental, social, physical, economic, political. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372673))
1
- For Christians, a primary role of communication therefore is to aid in the process of liberation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372674))
1
- The good news requires that communication in the community takes into account all persons, and the whole person, and that it deal with them as sons and daughters of God. Communication that does otherwise, that treats persons as objects, is in fact oppressing them. Christians therefore have an advocacy role, to proclaim the good news and to work toward the fulfillment of its promise in the media of our times. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372679))
1
- inally, Christian doctrine challenges falsehood. Christianity is not "evenhanded." It has a bias toward what it perceives to be real and true. The fact that we live in a pluralistic society means that as Christians we must be a witness for the truth as we perceive it while at the same time being open to hear the truth as perceived by others. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372683))
1
- A number of theologians have described ways in which Christian communication can be distorted.(30). Five situations are particularly destructive to effective communication within the Christian community:
  1. When loyalty to the church is substituted for loyalty to God. This happens when the church is believed because the source (church) is substituted for the message (God). The greatest distortions of this kind come when the church tries to communicate that it is the invulnerable possessor of truth.
  2. When the Bible is substituted for God as an object of ultimate loyalty and faith, that is, when the authority of the Bible is substituted for the authority of God.
  3. When Christology is substituted for theology, that is, love of Christ for the love of God.
  4. When the church cuts itself off from its own tradition, or when that tradition is treated as something objective and final from the past, rather than as living memory in which the community of faith actively takes part and to which they add their own life-stories.
  5. When Scripture is allegorized so that it caters to the desires of people for simple solutions at the expense of faithfulness to reality, or when scripture is taken so literally that attempts at new scriptural understanding are considered a betrayal of the original communication. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372694))
1
- In this context, communication is the sharing of something experienced, by means of commonly understood relationships. Reduced to its minimum, this kind of communication can be pictured as a process involving source-encoding-signal-decoding-destination. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372701))
1
- And love, the essential Christian message, can be made manifest only by "credible preaching by word and deed, on the one side, and by practical commitment (i.e., faith) on the part of the recipient."(17) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372716))
1
- This means that the purpose of Christian communication is not to ask, "How can we communicate the gospel in such a way that others will accept it?" This is the wrong question, the public relations question, the manipulative question, the question asked by the electronic church. Rather, our task is to put the gospel before people in such a way that it is so clear to them that they can accept it, or reject it -- but always for the right reasons. As Tillich points out, it is better that people reject the gospel for the right reasons than that they accept it for the wrong reasons.(19) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372732))
1
- External history is that set of experiences which are available to everyone: they are events, ideas, actions, experiments that can be duplicated. External events are impersonal. In the Christian tradition, they include such things as the "historical Jesus" and the Dead Sea Scrolls. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372744))
1
- The content of Christian communication is essentially what God has done in the lives of individuals, including me. There are many points of potential contact -- history, nature, group experiences, individual’s stories, the Bible. The content can be logical or charted or related to biblical passages or theologies -- or it may not. What is important is that the content explains the internal history of the communicator and results in the recipient gaining perspective on the nature of what is ultimate reality, that is, the way things are. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372754))
1
- On the other hand, both communication theory and common sense tell us that the difficulty of successful communication increases with the relational distance one perceives. Note that real physical distance is not what is important, but rather perceived relational distance. One can "be" very close to one’s wife over a 3000 mile telephone, or "be" very distant from the president who passes only 20 feet away in a swiftly moving motorcade. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372765))
1
- The same holds true for any communication that is remote in space or time: the greater the perceived distance between those communicating, the more difficult the communication of meaning becomes. This is true simply because the authentic source ("my story") is less available, less present, less accessible to the perceiver. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383425715/15372768))
