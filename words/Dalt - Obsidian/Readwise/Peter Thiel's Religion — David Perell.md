A - Peter Thiel's Religion — David Perell

1
- Rene Girard was a French historian and literary critic. He’s famous for Mimetic Theory, which forms the bedrock of Thiel’s worldview. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696511))
1
- Mimetic Theory rests on the assumption that all our cultural behaviors, beginning with the acquisition of language by children are imitative. He sees the world as a theatre of envy, where, like mimes, we imitate other people’s desires. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696514))
1
- Mimetic conflict emerges when two people desire the same, scarce resource. Like lions in a cage, we mirror our enemies, fight because of our sameness, and ascend status hierarchies instead of providing value for society. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696518))
1
- Mimesis is the Greek word for imitation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696519))
1
- Competition distracts us from things that are more important, meaningful, or valuable. We buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696524))
1
- Law school was worse. Like lobsters in a bucket, wannabe lawyers battled for law school placement and law firm employment. Each goal led to the next. Rather than focusing their attention on the end goal of developing a legal expertise, transforming the Constitution, or rescuing the powerless from tyrannical injustice, they elbowed their peers so they could score higher than their classmates on standardized tests.

1
- Sometimes, I wonder if he sees life as a game of chess, where he plays against himself and simultaneously switches from black, to white, and back again. Listen carefully and you’ll see how often he hides answers inside of questions. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696531))
1
- Before playing a game, you have to know the rules. Breakthrough businesses are so innovative that people don’t have the words to describe them. He focuses on questions as much as answers, so he can identify the difference that makes the difference. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696533))
1
- In response, as CEO of PayPal, Thiel set up the company structure to eliminate competition between employees. PayPal overhauled the organization chart every three months. By repositioning people, the company avoided most conflicts before they even started. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696538))

- Section 1: Don’t Copy Your Neighbors ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696544))
1
- When those differences collapse, the infectious spread of violence accelerates. The fiercest rivalries emerge not between people who are different, but people who are the same. The more two people share the same desires, the greater the risk of Mimetic competition. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696547))
1
- Similar people are most prone to Mimetic envy because we tend to compete for status with the people who are closest to us. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696551))
1
- Shakespeare wasn’t the only writer to identify the vicious Mimetic impulse. Sigmund Freud called the tendency for conflict between two similar people “The Narcissism of Small Differences.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696561))
1
- Thomas Hobbes wrote that “if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their End... endeavor to destroy, or subdue one another.“ ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696563))
1
- By obsessing over their competitors, the faculty lost sight over the big picture and fought over the small scraps of superficial status games. The more they strived to be different, the more their actions mirrored each other. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696566))
1
- Choose your enemies well. Like two children who fight for a toy, the more you fight somebody, the more you resemble your enemy. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696567))
1
- Girard observed that even when you put a group of kids together in a room full of toys, they’ll inevitably desire the same toy instead of finding their own toy to play with. A rivalry will emerge. Human see, human want. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696571))

- In one study, Henrich found that babies engaged in social referencing four times more often when an ambiguous toy was placed in front of them. When faced with an ambiguous toy, babies altered their behavior based on adults’ emotional reactions. In their early years, babies depend on elders to navigate the world and outsource their decisions to them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696841))
1
- Mimetic competition is visible in every aspect of social life. People shift their attention from the object of desire to the other person, and the drive to beat them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696844))
1
- What I prefer over trends is a sense of mission. That you are working on a unique problem that people are not solving elsewhere.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696849))
1
- We analogize business to war. In war, victory requires that the enemy is crippled or destroyed. Rivals who pursue the “one best way” to compete will converge on a collision course, where everybody listens to the same advice and pursues the same strategies, leading to zero-sum outcomes where total industry profits fall towards nothing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696854))
1
- When you compete to be the best, you imitate. When you compete to be unique, you innovate. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696856))
1
- While imitation creates a race to the bottom, innovation promotes healthy competition and economic growth. In that way, business is like the performing arts, not war. In the performing arts there are many entertaining singers and actors, each with a distinct style. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696862))
1
- High profits attract competition. According to economic theory, if outside entrepreneurs hear about profits, they’ll start a new firm and enter the industry. Increased supply will drive prices down, which will decrease total industry profits. If too many firms enter the market, the entire industry will suffer losses. If companies start to lose money, they’ll go out of business until industry prices rise back to sustainable levels. Most importantly, in a world of perfect competition, no company will make an economic profit in the long run. Just like the airline industry.

1
- But companies who have a monopoly can set their own prices since they offer an in-demand product that cannot be replicated. Monopoly firms are big fish in a small pond ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696908))
1
- Christians do not take it as a symbol, but as a concrete fact. Christians say that if you believe in Jesus — that he was raised from the dead and is the Son of God — he will restore your life until every pain and heartache becomes untrue. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696915))

    - Note: this is not the Christian theology. this is the western interpretation of Christian theology. Tweet
1
- When Jesus died on the cross, he paid for the sins of humanity so he could end evil and suffering. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696922))

    - Note: Not true either

- St. Augustine. His book, The City of God, ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696933))
1
- Beginning with the Greeks and accelerated by the Christian writers such as St. Augustine, Western philosophy is defined by the march towards heavenly perfection. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696937))
1
- When humans engage in a Mimetic crisis, the violence can only be fixed by murdering the scapegoat. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696947))
1
- Girard said “sacrificial systems contain violence.” His message has two meanings. Violence is the disease and the cure for the disease. Sacrificial ritual is always violent. And yet, since the real and symbolic violence of sacrifice restores peace in the community, it prevents the escalation of runaway Mimetic violence. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696955))
1
- Creating explicit images of my future has made me healthier, happier, and much more productive. I re-write my 25-year vision multiple times per year. Then, twice a month, I meet with a personal coach to make sure my short-term actions sync up with my long-term goals. By treating my future self with the same respect as my current self, I’m better able to ignore the nagging impulses of the moment and work towards a better future for myself and humanity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696958))
1
- Girard offers a historical perspective for the transition from cyclical time to linear time. He identified a cyclical loop: First, when a scapegoat is sacrificed, peace is restored in the community. Then, the culture lives peacefully for a short time. But eventually, tensions flare and violence returns to the community. To restore the peace, a new scapegoat must be named and sacrificed, which re-starts the sacrificial loop. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696971))
1
- Greatness is like chess. To win, you must study the end game and work towards the one you want to see. Thiel’s favorite chess player was José Raúl Capablanca who said: “To begin you must study the end. You don’t want to be the first to act, you want to be the last man standing.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14696974))
1
- Elise Boulding once said: “If one is mentally out of breath all the time from dealing with the present, there is no energy left for imagining the future.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14717079))
1
- stagnation leads straight to apocalypse ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14717091))
1
- Christians were the first group to reject cyclical time. They shouted that the future could be meaningfully better than the past. By doing so, they initiated a positive feedback loop, where progress led to progress, which led to more progress. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1364602684/14717093))
