    - Note: This is a cool thing to do for thinkers I admire. Just update a page with all of their ideas.
1
- When I sense I’m not realizing the full potential of my time and attention, I return to Cal’s ideas on solitude and high-quality leisure and attention residue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnm42yw56znrf4ep5pf7ws5))
1
- In *[So Good They Can’t Ignore You,](https://geni.us/9Sp1sF)* Cal cites the research of organization psychologist Amy Wrzesniewski. Wrzesniewski found that people identify their work one of the three ways: a job (a way to pay the bills), a career (a path to increasingly better work), or a calling (a vital part of their life/identity).

    - Note: Interesting way to think about work
1
- And the strongest predictor of experiencing work as a calling, of loving what they do, was the number of years worked. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnm6n1tk82n6dy346tmse06))
1
- Passion, in other words, follows. It’s a byproduct, a side effect, spun out of a complex web of elements that are agnostic to the specific type of work a job requires. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnm6w29509njh0cdgy1ajw1))
1
- Some creative freedom, impact, control over what you do and when you do it and who you do it with—these are some of the traits people want (and people who love what they do have) in their job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnm7t6q618e8128y2wydbgm))
1
- Reading Martin’s *[Born Standing Up](https://geni.us/gJ2gHwP)* very powerfully crystallized something in my brain: the prize never goes to the person who shows up with the most talent, it goes to the person who sticks around longest.

- Someone stood up in an audience once and asked, how do you become successful? “You have to become undeniably good at something,” he said. “Nobody ever takes my advice, because it’s not the answer they wanted to hear…but I always say, ‘Be so good they can’t ignore you.’” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnm9wqby3xrzhc3gsegzcmm))

- For most of human history, you didn’t have a job, you had a craft or a trade. You were a carpenter or a blacksmith or a mason or a potter or a sculptor or a shoemaker. And you found the source of meaning and satisfaction just about everywhere but in you. “The task of the craftsman,” Cal writes that Dreyfus and Kelly wrote, “is not to generate the meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill for discerning the meanings that are already there.” To the craftsman, wherever there is a choice between doing it well or doing it poorly, there is an opportunity for meaning. Because anything—however lowly, however noble—done well is satisfying. “You don’t need a rarified job,” Cal writes in *[Deep Work](https://geni.us/3ExB0),* “you need a rarified approach to your work.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnmcgnyhf9yf8b0r8ng34n5))

- To cultivate and amplify the ability to go deep, [Cal writes](https://geni.us/3ExB0), “is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your life.” In the way a baseball batter cultivates the ability to go long by strengthening their physical muscles away from the ballpark, a knowledge worker cultivates the ability to go deep by strengthening their mental muscles away from the workplace… ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnmemrdmgms6mv4ryr2wcem))

- To help your brain’s ability to concentrate at a high level, you must train it to tolerate boredom ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnmhkffrd1pez296f70hjg8))
1
- This psychological effect has a name: attention residue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnn7a0ry4cn6q45xttx2b19))
2
    - Note: When you switch from task to task, part of your attention doesn’t make that switch. You’re now left unable to completely focus back on that which you were focusing prior.
1
- If, like most,” [Cal writes in a blog post about attention residue and the classic arcade game, Snake](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/06/a-productivity-lesson-from-a-classic-arcade-game/), “you rarely go more than 10 – 15 minutes without a just check, you have effectively put yourself in a persistent state of self-imposed cognitive handicap. The flip side, of course, is to imagine the relative cognitive enhancement that would follow by minimizing this effect.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnn752eyqtk71zzsngvg2rz))

- Solitude is, here’s Cal, “a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnnrc5pnmysm0f2wvesrxh5))
1
- If you want to produce ideas, creative thoughts, some understanding of the self, some clarity of purpose, regular doses of solitude is a prerequisite. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnns79qsf6yj3y4pg4w1ptq))
2
    - Note: Lesson: solitude is necessary for creation. Put another way, creation is a by-product of solitude.
1
- Cal’s theory of procrastination is that when you procrastinate, your brain is calling you out. It believes that your idea or your plan is as unreasonable or haphazard an idea or plan as charging the mammoth with a rock. It is not convinced that the effort will lead to something positive in the future. So “procrastination is not a character flaw but instead a finely-tuned evolutionary adaptation,” [Cal writes](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2011/07/10/the-procrastinating-caveman-what-human-evolution-teaches-us-about-why-we-put-off-work-and-how-to-stop/#comments). “You shouldn’t lament procrastination, but instead listen to it. Treat it as a sign…[as] a constructive source of criticism — a voice from our paleolithic past telling us that although it likes our goals, we need to put a little bit more thought into how we’re going to get there.” If you want motivation or discipline or energy, convince your brain. That what you’re trying to accomplish is important. And that you have the right plan for accomplishing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnp3tgkf9xw4f9crdb2tf4m))

    - Note: Why we procrastinate
1
- In his short volume *[How to Live on 24 Hours a Day](https://geni.us/AVQm),* Bennett zeroed in on the question of how one realizes the full potential of the hours outside of work. Essentially, bias towards mentally or physically strenuous activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnpb471rrbskj4b1g326wea))

- One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnpeqw8a98yrrrcxbk59mvg))

- *Prioritize demanding activity*—“the value you receive from a pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnpf5r5g8enh94d6wq7px98))
