B - The Road

1
- Nights dark beyond darkness ([Location 45](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=45))
1
- Just remember that the things you put into your head are there forever, he said. You might want to think about that. You forget some things, dont you? Yes. You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=127))
1
- The blackness he woke to on those nights was sightless and impenetrable. A blackness to hurt your ears with listening. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=154))
1
- He said the right dreams for a man in peril were dreams of peril and all else was the call of languor and of death. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=180))
1
- If you break little promises you’ll break big ones. That’s what you said. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=331))
1
- He wore a beard that had been cut square across the bottom with shears and he had a tattoo of a bird on his neck done by someone with an illformed notion of their appearance. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=588))
1
- He held the boy’s hand as they stumbled through the woods. The other hand he held out before him. He could see no worse with his eyes shut. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=634))
1
- the fire to dry it. All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you’ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=695))
1
- I will kill anyone who touches you. Do you understand? Yes. He sat there cowled in the blanket. After a while he looked up. Are we still the good guys? he said. Yes. We’re still the good guys. And we always will be. Yes. We always will be. Okay. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=720))
1
- What if he doesnt have a papa? ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=796))
1
- All these things he saw and did not see. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1016))
1
- They were partly screened by the ruins of the privet but he knew they had minutes at most and maybe no minutes at all. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1038))
1
- He tried to remember if he knew anything about that or if it were only a fable. In what direction did lost men veer? ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1077))
1
- He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1212))
1
- thought each memory recalled must do some violence to its origins. As in a party game. Say the word and pass it on. So be sparing. What you alter in the remembering has yet a reality, known or not. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1222))
1
- Okay. This is what the good guys do. They keep trying. They dont give up. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1274))
1
- What do you think? the man said. Warm at last. Warm at last? Yes. Where did you get that? I dont know. Okay. Warm at last. ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1364))
1
- dont know. Maybe you should always be on the lookout. If trouble comes when you least expect it then maybe the thing to do is to always expect it. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1408))
1
- When your dreams are of some world that never was or of some world that never will be and you are happy again then you will have given up. Do you understand? And you cant give up. I wont let you. ([Location 1769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1769))
1
- scavengers. A mile on and they began to come upon the dead. Figures half mired in the blacktop, clutching themselves, mouths howling. He put his hand on the boy’s shoulder. Take my hand, he said. I dont think you should see this. What you put in your head is there forever? Yes. ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0G1Q&location=1778))
