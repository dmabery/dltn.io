B - Stillness Is the Key

1
- To Seneca and to his fellow adherents of Stoic philosophy, if a person could develop peace within themselves—if they could achieve apatheia, ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=109))
1
- To be steady while the world spins around you. To act without frenzy. To hear only what needs to be heard. To possess quietude—exterior and interior—on command. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=122))
1
- To tap into the dao and the logos. The Word. The Way. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=124))
1
- “All of humanity’s problems,” Blaise Pascal said in 1654, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=140))
1
- They developed unique paths to the same critical destination: The stillness required to become master of one’s own life. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=142))
1
- Stillness is what aims the archer’s arrow. It inspires new ideas. It sharpens perspective and illuminates connections. It slows the ball down so that we might hit it. It generates a vision, helps us resist the passions of the mob, makes space for gratitude and wonder. Stillness allows us to persevere. To succeed. It is the key that unlocks the insights of genius, and allows us regular folks to understand them. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=147))
1
- the quiet moments are the best moments, and if so many wise, virtuous people have sung their praises, why are they so rare? ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=205))
1
- To achieve stillness, we’ll need to focus on three domains, the timeless trinity of mind, body, soul—the head, the heart, the flesh. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=217))
1
- This is, in fact, the first obligation of a leader and a decision maker. Our job is not to “go with our gut” or fixate on the first impression we form about an issue. No, we need to be strong enough to resist thinking that is too neat, too plausible, and therefore almost always wrong. Because if the leader can’t take the time to develop a clear sense of the bigger picture, who will? If the leader isn’t thinking through all the way to the end, who is? ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=261))
1
- Keep strong, if possible. In any case, keep cool. Have unlimited patience. Never corner an opponent, and always assist him to save face. Put yourself in his shoes—so as to see things through his eyes. Avoid self-righteousness like the devil—nothing is so self-blinding. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=273))
1
- “If people do not display statesmanlike wisdom,” he said, “they will eventually reach the point where they will clash, like blind moles, and then mutual annihilation will commence.” ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=328))
1
- The Daodejing. As he stared down nuclear annihilation, he was: Careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream. Alert as a warrior in enemy territory. Courteous as a guest. Fluid as melting ice. Shapable as a block of wood. Receptive as a valley. Clear as a glass of water. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=337))
1
- Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic philosopher who himself had stared down countless crises and challenges, Kennedy had been “like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands, unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.” ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=344))
1
- Each of us will, in our own lives, face crisis. The stakes may be lower, but to us they will matter. A business on the brink of collapse. An acrimonious divorce. A decision about the future of our career. A moment where the whole game depends on us. These situations will call upon all our mental resources. An emotional, reactive response—an unthinking, half-baked response—will not cut it. Not if we want to get it right. Not if we want to perform at our best. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=346))
1
- In these situations we must: Be fully present. Empty our mind of preconceptions. Take our time. Sit quietly and reflect. Reject distraction. Weigh advice against the counsel of our convictions. Deliberate without being paralyzed. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=351))
1
- The crisis was resolved thanks to a mastery of his own thinking, and the thinking of those underneath him—and it was these traits that America would need to call on repeatedly in the years to come. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=361))
1
- The lesson was one not of force but of the power of patience, alternating confidence and humility, foresight and presence, empathy and unbending conviction, restraint and toughness, and quiet solitude combined with wise counsel. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=363))
1
- “the domain of the mind”—because everything we do depends on getting that right. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=369))
1
- Tolstoy observed that love can’t exist off in the future. Love is only real if it’s happening right now. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=419))
1
- Remember, there’s no greatness in the future. Or clarity. Or insight. Or happiness. Or peace. There is only this moment. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=422))
1
- The less energy we waste regretting the past or worrying about the future, the more energy we will have for what’s in front of us. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=429))
1
- A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=447))
1
- As a general, Napoleon made it his habit to delay responding to the mail. His secretary was instructed to wait three weeks before opening any correspondence. When he finally did hear what was in a letter, Napoleon loved to note how many supposedly “important” issues had simply resolved themselves and no longer required a reply. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=449))
1
- There is way too much coming at us. In order to think clearly, it is essential that each of us figures out how to filter out the inconsequential from the essential. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=457))
1
- “If you wish to improve,” Epictetus once said, “be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.” ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=466))
1
- We need to cultivate a similar attitude—give things a little space, don’t consume news in real time, be a season or two behind on the latest trend or cultural phenomenon, don’t let your inbox lord over your life. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=469))
1
- If we were stiller, more confident, had the longer view, what truly meaningful subject could we dedicate our mental energy to? ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=477))
1
- What wild desires, what restless torments seize The hapless man, who feels the book-disease. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=482))
1
- One of his innovations was to organize information and problems into what’s now called the “Eisenhower Box,” a matrix that orders our priorities by their ratio of urgency and importance. Much that was happening in the world or on the job, Eisenhower found, was urgent but not important. Meanwhile, most of what was truly important was not remotely time-sensitive. Categorizing his inputs helped him organize his staff around what was important versus what seemed urgent, allowed them to be strategic rather than reactive, a mile deep on what mattered rather than an inch on too many things. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=490))

    - Note: For sure a youtube video
1
- In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says, “Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’” Knowing what not to think about. What to ignore and not to do. It’s your first and most important job. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=498))
1
- Before we can make deep changes in our lives, we have to look into our diet, our way of consuming. We have to live in such a way that we stop consuming the things that poison us and intoxicate us. Then we will have the strength to allow the best in us to arise, and we will no longer be victims of anger, of frustration. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=501))
1
- It means studying the world more philosophically—that is, with a long-term perspective—rather than following events second by second. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=509))
1
- Yes. It was possible to stand. Nothing happened. I listened. There was no sound: no boats on the river, no trucks on the road, not even cicadas. What if I didn’t listen to the news? I didn’t. Nothing happened. I realized I had been afraid of the silence. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=517))
1
- “Man is a thinking reed,” D. T. Suzuki, one of the early popularizers of Buddhism in the West, once said, “but his great works are done when he is not calculating and thinking. ‘Childlikeness’ has to be restored with long years of training in the art of self-forgetfulness. When this is attained, man thinks yet he does not think.” ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=543))
1
- Chop wood, carry water. Chop wood, carry water. Chop wood, carry water. Don’t overanalyze. Do the work. Don’t think. Hit. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=555))
1
- “If we’re anxious or nervous when we make the catch or throw, what will become of the game, and how can one maintain one’s composure; how can one see what is coming next?” ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=589))
1
- The Daodejing points out that when clay is formed around emptiness, it becomes a pitcher that can hold water. Water from the pitcher is poured into a cup, which is itself formed around emptiness. The room this all happens in is itself four walls formed around emptiness. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=597))
1
- L’essentiel est invisible pour les yeux. What’s essential is invisible to the eye. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=625))
1
- Epictetus talked about how the job of a philosopher is to take our impressions—what we see, hear, and think—and put them to the test. He said we needed to hold up our thoughts and examine them, to make sure we weren’t being led astray by appearances or missing what couldn’t be seen by the naked eye. Indeed, it is in Stoicism and Buddhism ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=631))
1
- We have to do the kind of thinking that 99 percent of the population is just not doing, and we have to stop doing the destructive thinking that they spend 99 percent of their time doing. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=648))
1
- “Suddenly,” Hakuin promised his students, “unexpectedly your teeth sink in. Your body will pour with cold sweat. At the instant, it will all become clear.” The word for this was satori—an illuminating insight when the inscrutable is revealed, when an essential truth becomes obvious and inescapable. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=655))
1
- Your job, after you have emptied your mind, is to slow down and think. To really think, on a regular basis.  . . . Think about what’s important to you.  . . . Think about what’s actually going on.  . . . Think about what might be hidden from view.  . . . Think about what the rest of the chessboard looks like.  . . . Think about what the meaning of life really is. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=671))
1
- Sit alone in a room and let your thoughts go wherever they will. Do this for one minute. . . . Work up to ten minutes a day of this mindless mental wandering. Then start paying attention to your thoughts to see if a word or goal materializes. If it doesn’t, extend the exercise to eleven minutes, then twelve, then thirteen . . . until you find the length of time you need to ensure that something interesting will come to mind. The Gaelic phrase for this state of mind is “quietness without loneliness.” ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=679))
1
- “Paper,” she said, “has more patience than people.” ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=704))
1
- Michel Foucault talked of the ancient genre of hupomnemata (notes to oneself). He called the journal a “weapon for spiritual combat,” a way to practice philosophy and purge the mind of agitation and foolishness and to overcome difficulty. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=721))
1
- That’s really the idea. Instead of carrying that baggage around in our heads or hearts, we put it down on paper. Instead of letting racing thoughts run unchecked or leaving half-baked assumptions unquestioned, we force ourselves to write and examine them. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=734))
1
- I am taking up my Journal again after a long break. I think it may be a way of calming this nervous excitement that has been worrying me for so long. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=744))
1
- All profound things, and emotions of things are preceded and attended by Silence. . . . Silence is the general consecration of the universe. —HERMAN MELVILLE ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=752))
1
- “Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise,” he would say. “When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating.” ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=762))
1
- In fact, 4′33″ was never about achieving perfect silence—it’s about what happens when you stop contributing to the noise. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=777))
1
- They’d rather close their mind than sit there and have to use ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=787))
1
- “Thought will not work except in silence,” Thomas Carlyle said. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=788))
1
- Six hundred years after Socrates’s death, Diogenes Laërtius would write that what made Socrates so wise was that “he knew nothing except just the fact of his ignorance.” ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=815))
1
- Xunzi was more explicit: “Learning must never cease. . . . The noble person who studies widely and examines himself each day will become clear in his knowing and faultless in his conduct.” ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=828))
1
- Tolstoy expressed his exasperation at people who didn’t read deeply and regularly. “I cannot understand,” he said, “how some people can live without communicating with the wisest people who ever lived on earth.” There’s another line, now cliché, that is even more cutting: People who don’t read have no advantage over those who cannot read. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=835))
1
- In Buddhism, there is the idea of pabbajja, which means “to go forth” and marks the serious beginning of one’s studies. That’s what Zeno was doing. Answering the call and going forth. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=844))
1
- The wise are still because they have seen it all. They know what to expect because they’ve been through so much. They’ve made mistakes and learned from them. And so must you. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=855))
1
- We want to sit with doubt. We want to savor it. We want to follow it where it leads. Because on the other side is truth. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=864))
1
- This toxic form of ego has a less-assuming evil twin—often called “imposter syndrome.” It’s a nagging, endless anxiety that you’re not qualified for what you’re doing—and you’re about to be found out for it. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=895))
1
- What is better than these two extremes—ego and imposter syndrome—but simple confidence? Earned. Rational. Objective. Still. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=901))
1
- Ego, on the other hand, is unsettled by doubts, afflicted by hubris, exposed by its own boasting and posturing. And yet it will not probe itself—or allow itself to be probed—because it knows what might be found. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=921))
1
- This is key. Both egotistical and insecure people make their flaws central to their identity—either by covering them up or by brooding over them or externalizing them. For them stillness is impossible, because stillness can only be rooted in strength. That’s what we have to focus on. Don’t feed insecurity. Don’t feed delusions of grandeur. Both are obstacles to stillness. Be confident. You’ve earned it. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=935))
1
- He preferred instead to teach his students an important mental skill: detachment. “What stands in your way,” Kenzo once told his student Eugen Herrigel, “is that you have too much willful will.” It was this willful will—the desire to be in control and to dictate the schedule and the process of everything we’re a part of—that held Herrigel back from learning, from really mastering the art he pursued. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=945))
1
- Have you ever noticed that the more we want something, the more insistent we are on a certain outcome, the more difficult it can be to achieve it? ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=956))
1
- On the contrary, after a bull’s-eye, Kenzo would urge them to “go on practicing as if nothing happened.” He’d say the same after a bad shot. When the students asked for extra instruction, he’d reply, “Don’t ask, practice!” ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=980))
1
- This is the balance we want to strike. If we aim for the trophy in life—be it recognition or wealth or power—we’ll miss the target. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=988))
1
- What we should be doing is practicing. What we should be doing is pushing away that willful will. ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=990))
1
- We try, in the words of Marcus Aurelius, to “shrug it all off and wipe it clean—every annoyance and distraction—and reach utter stillness.” To build a kind of mental vault or stronghold that no distraction or false impression can breach. For brief moments, we are able to get there. And when we’re there, we find ourselves capable of things we didn’t even know were possible: Superior performance. Awesome clarity. Profound happiness. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1000))
1
- “The mind tends toward stillness,” Lao Tzu said, “but is opposed by craving.” ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1006))
1
- It’s going to require some holistic self-examination, treating the disease and not just the symptoms. The ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1010))
1
- And as any seasoned captain of the seas of life can tell you, what’s happening on the surface of the water doesn’t matter—it’s what’s going on below that will kill you. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1047))
1
- We cannot be in harmony with anyone or anything if the need for more, more, more is gnawing at our insides like a maggot. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1141))
1
- Marcus Aurelius would ask himself, “What am I doing with my soul? Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-called mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child’s soul? An adolescent’s? . . . A tyrant’s soul? The soul of a predator—or its prey?” ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1150))
1
- It’s work located in the heart and in the soul, and not in the mind. Because it is our soul that is the key to our happiness (or our unhappiness), contentment (or discontent), moderation (or gluttony), and stillness (or perturbation). ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1166))
1
- The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1179))
1
- Virtue, the Stoics believed, was the highest good—the summum bonum—and should be the principle behind all our actions. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1184))
1
- No one has less serenity than the person who does not know what is right or wrong. No one is more exhausted than the person who, because they lack a moral code, must belabor every decision and consider every temptation. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1192))
1
- When we’re going into a tough assignment, we can say to ourselves over and over again, “Strength and courage.” Before a tough conversation with a significant other: “Patience and kindness.” In times of corruption and evil: “Goodness and honesty.” ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1205))
1
- It is impossible to live the pleasant life without also living sensibly, nobly, and justly, and conversely it is impossible to live sensibly, nobly, and justly without living pleasantly. A person who does not have a pleasant life is not living sensibly, nobly, and justly, and conversely the person who does not have these virtues cannot live pleasantly. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1215))
1
- Confucius wrote that the “gentleman is self-possessed and relaxed, while the petty man is perpetually full of worry.” ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1219))
1
- No one can stop you from knowing what’s right. Nothing stands between you and it . . . but yourself. Each of us must cultivate a moral code, a higher standard that we love almost more than life itself. Each of us must sit down and ask: What’s important to me? What would I rather die for than betray? How am I going to live and why? ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1242))
1
- The formula was simple and is key to breaking the cycle and stilling the deep anguish we carry around with us: Give more. Give what you didn’t get. Love more. Drop the old story. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1325))
1
- What will happen to me if I get what I want? How will I feel after? ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1375))
1
- To have an impulse and to resist it, to sit with it and examine it, to let it pass by like a bad smell—this is how we develop spiritual strength. ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1402))
1
- No one achieves excellence or enlightenment without a desire to get better, without a tendency to explore potential areas of improvement. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1432))
1
- The need for progress can be the enemy of enjoying the process. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MJ3TDCZ&location=1435))
1
