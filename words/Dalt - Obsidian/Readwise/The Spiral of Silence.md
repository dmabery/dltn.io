A - The Spiral of Silence

1
- The theory explains how societies form collective opinions and how we make decisions surrounding loaded topics.
1
- According to Noelle-Neumann’s theory, our willingness to express an opinion is a direct result of how popular or unpopular we perceive it to be. If we think an opinion is unpopular, we will avoid expressing it. If we think it is popular, we will make a point of showing we think the same as others.
1
- Controversy is also a factor—we may be willing to express an unpopular uncontroversial opinion but not an unpopular controversial one. We perform a complex dance whenever we share views on anything morally loaded.
1
- Anyone who expresses an unpopular opinion risks social exclusion or even ostracism within a particular context or in general.
1
- A feedback loop pushes minority opinions towards less and less visibility—hence why Noelle-Neumann used the word “spiral.” Each time someone voices a majority opinion, they reinforce the sense that it is safe to do so. Each time someone receives a negative response for voicing a minority opinion, it signals to anyone sharing their view to avoid expressing it.
1
- The end result of the spiral of silence is a point where no one publicly voices a minority opinion, regardless of how many people believe it. The first implication of this is that the picture we have of what most people believe is not always accurate.
1
- A second implication is that the possibility of discord makes us less likely to voice an opinion at all, assuming we are not trying to drum up conflict.
1
- If we want to gauge what people think about something, we need to remove the possibility of negative consequences.
1
- A third implication is that what seems like a sudden change in mainstream opinions can in fact be the result of a shift in what is acceptable to voice, not in what people actually think.
1
- A fourth implication is that highly vocal holders of a minority opinion can end up having a disproportionate influence on public discourse
1
- In anonymous environments, the spiral of silence can end up reversing itself, making the most fringe views the loudest.
