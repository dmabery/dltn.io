A - 3 Thoughts on a Decade of Publishing Books

1
- What I wish I could have told myself when I was hopeless about my writing prospects is that I should have defined artistic success in ways that weren’t shaped by forces beyond my control… Writing and publishing are two very different things… The only thing you can control is how you write and how hard you work.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsgwdfprfx7fntc65tnj2nwr))

  2. Get famous first
  3. You’re CEO of your own multimedia empire
  All of this can be boiled down to: *Run your own show*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsgwg9k692ta8t9sj86vrtf6))

- In my work, [problems of output are problems of input](https://austinkleon.com/2015/11/12/problems-of-output-are-problems-of-input/). If my work sucks, it’s usually because I’m not being a good enough fan. I need to read, and read voraciously, searching for that thing that’s going to get me back on track. Read books, write books, repeat. That’s the deal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsgwqnn62s9qwnxaq2fdm0wc))
