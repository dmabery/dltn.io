B - Zero to One

1
- Preface ZERO TO ONE ([Location 42](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=42))
1
- Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=48))
1
- This would be depressing but for one crucial fact: humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles technology. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=56))
1
- Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level. ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=57))
1
- These are the kind of elementary truths we teach to second graders, but they are easy to forget in a world where so much of what we do is repeat what has been done before. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=61))
1
- Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=67))
1
- 1 THE CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=75))
1
- In the most minimal sense, the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive and important isn’t that it hasn’t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=88))
1
- If things change radically in the next decade, then the future is nearly at hand. No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=91))
1
- Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work—going from 1 to n. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=95))
1
- Vertical or intensive progress means doing new things—going from 0 to ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=97))
1
- If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=98))
1
- At the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization—taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=101))
1
- The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=106))
1
- Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=109))
1
- Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not riches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=122))
1
- Today our challenge is to both imagine and create the new technologies that can make the 21st century more peaceful and prosperous than the 20th. ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=133))
1
- Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can. Positively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=142))
1
- Because that is what a startup has to do: question received ideas and rethink business from scratch. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=147))
1
- The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=161))
1
- The Mosaic browser was officially released in November 1993, giving regular people a way to get online. Mosaic became Netscape, which released its Navigator browser in late 1994. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=179))
1
- Navigator’s adoption grew so quickly—from about 20% of the browser market in January 1995 to almost 80% less than 12 months later—that Netscape was able to IPO in August ’95 even though it wasn’t yet profitable. Within five months, Netscape stock had shot up from $28 to $174 per share. Other tech companies were booming, too. Yahoo! went public in April ’96 with an $848 million valuation. Amazon followed suit in May ’97 at $438 million. By spring of ’98, each company’s stock had more than quadrupled. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=180))
1
- But it’s hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing; irrationality was rational given that appending “.com” to your name could double your value overnight. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=212))
1
- The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lessons from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today: ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=250))
1
- 1. Make incremental advances ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=252))
1
- 2. Stay lean and flexible ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=255))
1
- 3. Improve on the competition ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=258))
1
- you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=260))
1
- 4. Focus on product, not sales ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=261))
1
- To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=276))
1
- how much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=277))
1
- what valuable company is nobody building? ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=281))
1
- Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=283))
1
- So-called perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer demand. Every ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=292))
1
- Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=296))
1
- if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=307))
1
- Think about how Google talks about its business. It certainly doesn’t claim to be a monopoly. But is it one? Well, it depends: a monopoly in what? ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=320))
1
- Framing itself as just another tech company allows Google to escape all sorts of unwanted attention. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=334))
1
- Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets: ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=358))
1
- British food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto Rap star ∩ hackers ∩ sharks ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=359))
1
- Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=361))
1
- Google’s motto—“Don’t be evil”—is in part a branding ploy, ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=381))
1
- In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=383))
1
- Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=383))
1
- In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for a long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=384))
1
- in business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=416))
1
- Monopoly is the condition of every successful business. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=421))
1
- All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=423))
1
- Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the past. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=481))
1
- Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=500))
1
- Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that’s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=530))
1
- But a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=550))
1
- Simply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. (To properly value a business, you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.) ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=552))
1
- If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now? ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=582))
1
- What does a company with large cash flows far into the future look like? Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=585))
1
- Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=590))
1
- As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=595))
1
- This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business opportunities at all. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=624))
1
- Brand, scale, network effects, and technology in some combination define a monopoly; but to get them to work, you need to choose your market carefully and expand deliberately. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=660))
1
- Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=662))
1
- The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=672))
1
- Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=677))
1
- But if you truly want to make something new, the act of creation is far more important than the old industries that might not like what you create. Indeed, ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=705))
1
- As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=717))
1
- What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=721))
1
- In this one particular at least, business is like chess. Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca put it well: to succeed, “you must study the endgame before everything else.” ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=724))
1
- Malcolm Gladwell, a successful author who writes about successful people, declares in Outliers that success results from a “patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages.” ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=730))
1
- Statistics doesn’t work when the sample size is one. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=749))
1
- “Victory awaits him who has everything in order—luck, people call it.” ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=753))
1
- Learning about startups is worthless if you’re just reading stories about people who won the lottery. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=755))
1
- You can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=761))
1
- Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=768))
1
- Combining these possibilities yields four views: ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=774))
1
- An indefinite pessimist looks out onto a bleak future, but he has no idea what to do about it. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=777))
1
- A definite pessimist believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=785))
1
- To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=799))
1
- But would anybody today take such a vision seriously in the first place? In the 1950s, people welcomed big plans and asked whether they would work. Today a grand plan coming from a schoolteacher would be dismissed as crankery, and a long-range vision coming from anyone more powerful would be derided as hubris. You can still visit the Bay Model in that Sausalito warehouse, but today it’s just a tourist attraction: big plans for the future have become archaic curiosities. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=824))
1
- To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=833))
1
- But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=872))
1
- A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random. ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=989))
1
- Whatever Einstein did or didn’t say, the power law—so named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions—is the law of the universe. It defines our surroundings so completely that we usually don’t even see it. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1015))
1
- Rather, they follow a power law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all others. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1037))
1
- The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1044))
1
- VCs must find the handful of companies that will successfully go from 0 to 1 and then back them with every resource. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1054))
1
- After all, less than 1% of new businesses started each year in the U.S. receive venture funding, and total VC investment accounts for less than 0.2% of GDP. But the results of those investments disproportionately propel the entire economy. Venture-backed companies create 11% of all private sector jobs. They generate annual revenues equivalent to an astounding 21% of GDP. Indeed, the dozen largest tech companies were all venture-backed. Together those 12 companies are worth more than $2 trillion, more than all other tech companies combined ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1079))
1
- An entrepreneur cannot “diversify” herself: you cannot run dozens of companies at the same time and then hope that one of them works out well. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1092))
1
- “it doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do it well.” That is completely false. It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future. ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1100))
1
- You could have 100% of the equity if you fully fund your own venture, but if it fails you’ll have 100% of nothing. Owning just 0.01% of Google, by contrast, is incredibly valuable (more than $35 million as of this writing). ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1106))
1
- If you do start your own company, you must remember the power law to operate it well. The most important things are singular: One market will probably be better than all others, as we discussed in Chapter 5. One distribution strategy usually dominates all others, too—for that see Chapter 11. Time and decision-making themselves follow a power law, and some moments matter far more than others—see Chapter ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1108))
1
- Remember our contrarian question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1121))
1
- Contrarian thinking doesn’t make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1124))
1
- If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1132))
1
- This is the classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible. Kaczynski argued that modern people are depressed because all the world’s hard problems have already been solved. What’s left to do is either easy or impossible, and pursuing those tasks is deeply unsatisfying. ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1147))
1
- If everything worth doing has already been done, you may as well feign an allergy to achievement and become a barista. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1154))
1
- Along with the natural fact that physical frontiers have receded, four social trends have conspired to root out belief in secrets. First is incrementalism. From ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1169))
1
- Second is risk aversion. People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1174))
1
- Third is complacency. Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore new thinking, but they seem to believe in secrets the least. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1178))
1
- Fourth is “flatness.” As globalization advances, people perceive the world as one homogeneous, highly competitive marketplace: the world is “flat.” ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1182))
1
- Pierre de Fermat had conjectured in 1637 that no integers a, b, and c could satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer n greater than 2. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1229))
1
- If you think something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth. ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1234))
1
- The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1235))
1
- Great companies can be built on open but unsuspected secrets about how the world works. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1242))
1
- The same reason that so many internet companies, including Facebook, are often underestimated—their very simplicity—is itself an argument for secrets. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1248))
1
- There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1252))
1
- So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you? ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1255))

- Sometimes looking for natural secrets and looking for human secrets lead to the same truth. Consider the monopoly secret again: competition and capitalism are opposites. If you didn’t already know it, you could discover it the natural, empirical way: do a quantitative study of corporate profits and you’ll see they’re eliminated by competition. But you could also take the human approach and ask: what are people running companies not allowed to say? You would notice that monopolists downplay their monopoly status to avoid scrutiny, while competitive firms strategically exaggerate their uniqueness. The differences between firms only seem small on the surface; in fact, they are enormous. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1263))

- If you find a secret, you face a choice: Do you tell anyone? Or do you keep it to yourself? It depends on the secret: some are more dangerous than others. As Faust tells Wagner: The few who knew what might be learned, Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show, And reveal their feelings to the crowd below, Mankind has always crucified and burned.

- So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there’s always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody—and that’s a company. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.

- there are a few things that every business must get right at the beginning. I stress this so often that friends have teasingly nicknamed it “Thiel’s law”: a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.

- Bad decisions made early on—if you choose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example—are very hard to correct after they are made. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1314))

- To anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it’s useful to distinguish between three concepts: • Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity? • Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis? • Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs?

- Misalignment can creep in even if he receives stock compensation in the name of “shareholder value.” If that stock comes as a reward for short-term performance, he will find it more lucrative and much easier to cut costs instead of investing in a plan that might create more value for all shareholders far in the future.

- the boardroom, less is more. The smaller the board, the easier it is for the directors to communicate, to reach consensus, and to exercise effective oversight. ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1370))

- A board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J6YBOFQ&location=1373))
