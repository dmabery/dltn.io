A - A Master Class From David McCullough, America's Emeritus History Professor

- *It seems to me that one of the truths about history that needs to be portrayed is that nothing ever had to happen the way it happened. History could have gone off in any number of different directions in any number of different ways at any point along the way, just as your own life can. You never know. One thing leads to another. Nothing happens in a vacuum. Actions have consequences. These all sound self-evident. But they're not self-evident**—particularly to a young person trying to understand life.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kmwzpjxjhqjahqkjm3s53f))

- *Nobody lived in the past, if you stop to think about it. Jefferson, Adams, Washington**—they didn't walk around saying, "Isn't this fascinating, living in the past?" They lived in the present just as we do. The difference was it was their present, not ours. And just as we don't know how things are going to turn out for us, they didn't either. It's very easy to stand on the mountaintop as a historian or biographer and find fault with people for why they did this or didn't do that, because we're not involved in it, we're not inside it, we're not confronting what we don't know, as everyone who preceded us always was.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kmxtm20wnhbvbb8hmw3w05))

- Some of them ardently disliked others of them. Every one of them did things in his life he regretted. But the fact that they could rise to the occasion as they did, these imperfect human beings, and do what they did is also, of course, a testimony to their humanity. We are not just known by our failings, by our weaknesses, by our sins. We are known by being capable of rising to the occasion and exhibiting not just a sense of direction, but strength.

- *There's a wonderful incident that took place at the Cambria Iron Company in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in the 19th century, when they were building the first Bessemer steel machinery, adapted from what had been seen of the Bessemer process in Britain. There was a German engineer named John Fritz, and after working for months to get this machinery finished, he came into the plant one morning, and he said, "All right, boys, let's start her up and see why she doesn't work." That's very American. We will find out what's not working right and we will fix it, and then maybe it will work right. That's been our star, that's what we've guided on.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kn6k7rsrym55sqvqh9pj2e))

    - Note: Show up every day, learn figure out what's not working, make it better, and do it all over again tomorrow.

- And think of this: Almost no nations in the world know when they were born. We know exactly when we began and why we began and who did it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kn9mvwevcw2fmcbtz52th7))

    - Note: that's a great point honestly.

- We have to get across the idea that we have to know who we were if we're to know who we are and where we're headed. This is essential. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9knac5wb2dqajzv752qeg6v))

- *We have to value what our forebears**—and not just in the 18th century but our own parents and grandparents—did for us, or we're not going to take it very seriously and it can slip away. If you don't care about it—if you've inherited some great work of art that is worth a fortune and you don't know that it's worth a fortune, you don't even know that it's a great work of art and you're not interested in it—you're going to lose it.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9knay2x7ce0ng2vz08nctam))

- I like to think of what Churchill said when he crossed the Atlantic after Pearl Harbor and gave a magnificent speech. He said we haven't journeyed this far because we're made of sugar candy. It's as true today as it ever was. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9kndh33djncb02ztx48xx61))
