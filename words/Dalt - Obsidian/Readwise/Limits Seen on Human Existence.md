A - Limits Seen on Human Existence

1
- IS it possible, using statistics alone, to predict how long space exploration, the Catholic Church, the Miss America contest, the human race or the universe as a whole will continue to exist? A Princeton University astrophysicist has concluded that these and many other predictions are not only possible, but can be made with 95 percent reliability.

- Would emigrating to another planet set back the clock for the human race so that it could start anew and survive another couple of million years?
  "That's a question we can't answer from this vantage point on the Earth today," Dr. Gott says, "because it hasn't happened yet, it has no past and, therefore, we cannot calculate its future." ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1561356049/21532243))

- The mathematics used in these calculations assumes that the life span of anything, or group of things, can be represented by 40 equal intervals of time, each representing 2.5 percent of the total life span. If the objects or creatures or systems encompassed by their respective life spans are randomly distributed, the chances are 39 to 1 against any individual being in the earliest 2.5 percent of the life span, and equally against being in the last 2.5 percent.

- We're doing this calculation at the 95 percent confidence level, so that means that it's 95 percent likely that you're in the middle 95 percent of the life span of the human race, not in the first 2.5 percent or the last 2.5 percent. Your particular 2.5 percent is one-fortieth of the total longevity, so if you're at the beginning of that middle period, you have one-fortieth of the Homo sapiens life span behind you and 39-fortieths to go. But if you happen to be in the last 2.5 percent, you only have one-fortieth to go and the future is only one thirty-ninth as long as the past."

- The reason the Copernican principle works," Dr. Gott said, "is that of all the places for intelligent observers to be, there are many nonspecial places and only a few special places. We are not likely to be in one of them."
  Moreover, he said, "we have no data to reject this hypothesis at present, and it does explain a number of observed facts." ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1561356049/21532249))

- One is the fact that no signals have been received from intelligent civilizations from any nearby stars; the odds would be enormously against the existence of nearby civilizations, according to Dr. Gott's statistics. "If such signals were heard, it would tend to falsify this hypothesis," he said. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1561356049/21532250))
