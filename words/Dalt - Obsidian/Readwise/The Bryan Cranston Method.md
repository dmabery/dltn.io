A - The Bryan Cranston Method

- These include the four things you need to be a successful actor (talent, patience, persistence and luck), which are separate from the four things you need to be a *good* actor (still talent, but also curiosity, vulnerability and imagination).

- Before taking on a new role, Cranston famously assesses it using what he calls the Cranston Assessment of Project Scale (CAPS), a five-item list of subjects – story, script, role, director and cast – which are each given a numerical score. The total must add up to at least 13 for him to consider taking the job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r1408dg0s3b9qffj3frtmh))

- While planning their itineraries, Cranston triangulated the locations of women he and his brother had already hooked up with to create routes where they’d most likely encounter someone who’d give them a free place to stay. The cartographical method was called GIDGT: the Geographically Incredibly Desirable Girlfriend Tour. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r14r24w073j1vtyfh1x58d))

- Cranston’s co-stars talk about his meticulousness and ability to transform in and out of character with near reverence: “I learned the most about acting from acting in a room with Bryan Cranston,” Odenkirk says. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r182x5cgcn11jrspgk1vqg))

- Cranston brought the same focus to the somewhat less intense set of Wes Anderson’s new film [*Asteroid City*](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/asteroid-city-wes-anderson). During periods where he wasn’t working, Cranston sat in a chair taking notes on a legal pad, pages and pages, so much text that Schwartzman says it looked like he was working on a book. When he asked Cranston what he was writing, he said, “Oh, it’s just ideas.” On camera, Cranston would respond to Anderson’s directions with more specificity than Schwartzman had seen from any other actor.

- His *Asteroid City* co-star Scarlett Johansson says, “I always assumed he might be a self-aggrandising, actor-y actor, but he’s the complete opposite of that. He comes across as reserved and almost shy in person, completely unassuming – like he isn’t quite sure how he got there. And then the minute he’s performing, all of that humility melts away.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r1cda3862nbaxtj4j1q76h))

- **Cranston likes to** say that no one’s interested in a story about a nice man doing nice things; every protagonist needs to have that one thing barring them from their goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r1crbhq57n8wgz9q72mznj))

- He offers an example, unprompted, about Robin Dearden, his wife of 34 years. “My wife and I have been going to therapy together since before we were married,” he says. “I look at it like the warning light going off on your dashboard. It’s telling you, ‘You might want to pay attention to this.’ I love my wife, and we want to go the distance, but I want to do it in a healthy way. I don’t want to just be with her. I don’t want to just have the two of us go into a restaurant and no one says a word.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r1dmn10mn709jmbq72g4gg))

- Before Cranston signs someone onto a project he’s producing, he goes to their IMDb and makes a list of all the people he knows who have worked with the person, then calls them. This is to help ensure a good working environment; by now, Cranston has a big enough Rolodex to be able to vet almost anyone. “It rewards good behaviour, and I like doing that,” he says.

- “I think he sees from a bit further away than most people,” says Odenkirk with the perspective of someone who has likewise concluded the role of a lifetime. “He’s watched careers and he’s watched them up close, and he’s seen actors up close. He knows you gotta ride the various waves that come and go. Nothing’s gonna beat Walter White for world impact. It’s like Captain Kirk, you know? So what do you do with that? Well, you don’t get all upset about the fact that it’s that important to people and that it will always be. You find your way into other projects that are worthy, and you don’t keep insisting on the same degree of respect and attention that *Breaking Bad* brought you for each project… And if they’re good projects, you do ’em and you feel proud of ’em. You don’t get mad that they’re not all *Breaking Bad*.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r1sh2gyx74v6yxhnm366nh))

    - Note: Success, no matter how big, fades. You have to keep earning it.

- But then, the Cranston Method works because it can be refined, its calculations modified when new variables arise. Cranston tells me about a film he starred in a few years ago with James Franco called *Why Him?* He’d been wanting to do a comedy and fortuitously received the script from writer-director John Hamburg. But when he read it, it was… okay. Silly. Slight. “You know my scale,” he says of his CAPS system. “It didn’t make the scale. And why? Because I value story very highly, and that story was ‘Midwestern dad doesn’t like his daughter’s boyfriend.’ That was it! That was the story. What’s there? There’s nothing there.” Hamburg had done *I Love You, Man*, and Cranston knew its lead, Paul Rudd. So he called him. “Can you help me out?” he asked. “The script is really thin. What do you do?” He says Rudd told him, “This is the way most of them are. All those light comedies that I do, they’re fun as shit. I just love doing them because I have so much fun.”
  It was another epiphany for Cranston: “It’s okay to do something just for fun.” Not having fun because you’re trying to keep the mood right on a rigorous set, or fun to remove a mounting obstacle, or fun because you’ve been doing too much dramatic work. Just fun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2r1wnb6tr7888a1j32kcqpj))

    - Note: Systems, rules, and processes are there to be broken for a purpose. They stop you from doing things automatically. Rather than box you into certain roles, they enable you to expand what you're used to – as long as there is a true purpose behind them.
