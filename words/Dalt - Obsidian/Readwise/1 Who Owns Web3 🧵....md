- 2/ This grenade of a tweet by Twitter‚Äôs dad has fanned the flames.
  Whether you agree with it or not, it‚Äôs important.
  Time to establish nuance around what‚Äôs misleading, and what‚Äôs true here‚Äîand find out who owns web3. https://t.co/JHpRMMulJZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324246373965832))
1
- 3/ First, let‚Äôs dispense with the us vs. them mentality.
  We all know: not all VCs are bad. They help founders shoot their shots.
  But we also know why this warning exists. To prevent repeating the flaws of web2. VC is not perfect.
  Let‚Äôs explore how web3 is improving the model. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324247871369232))
1
- 4/ Web3 fundamentally tilts towards decentralization. Indie creators and brands, from Poolsuite to XCOPY, are bootstrapping capital directly from their communities.
  Does VC ‚Äúown‚Äù them? No.
  Compared to web2, we are arcing towards progress‚Äîlet‚Äôs not diminish this innovation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324249226096645))
1
- 5/ Web3 is by and large open-source, from code to block activity. Its openness and interoperability establishes the basis for decentralization.
  Disclaimer: ownership can also be assigned to off-chain entities.
  Still, a major QOL improvement over web2. https://t.co/U0lOsHvgCn ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324250266279944))
1
- 6/ Decentralization also enables new defenses.
  Because many projects can be ‚Äúforked‚Äù (duplicating their underlying source), participants can simply choose to follow value-aligned derivatives if the original project becomes extractive.
  This reinforces incentive alignment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324252027838465))
1
- 7/ Constituents can now move markets with coordinated buying and social media activity.
  Web3 fundamentally shifts customer roles away from pure consumption and towards community stakeholdership‚Äîproviding skin in the game and autonomy.
  Web3 enables activism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324253269352450))
1
- 8/ Let‚Äôs also be honest about the downsides of VC in web3.
  Simply put, 9/10 VC-backed companies fail.
  This is a problem, but it‚Äôs also a solution. It means more companies getting to shoot their shots.
  Yes, VC is a risky investment class‚Äîbut it has its place in the ecosystem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324254368251909))
1
- 9/ Some startups in particular will need major cash infusion to have any chance at scale‚Äîmore than they could raise from communities.
  Infra layers like Pinata or XMTP, for instance, are well-suited to VC or hybrid fundraising models.
  Not everything needs to be community-funded. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324256075341828))
1
- 10/ However, some VCs have raised outsized capital. This can lead to startups growing too fast, and inflated markups.
  Yes, some web3 startups will falter due to misaligned incentives. It‚Äôs OK to be skeptical.
  But let‚Äôs be realistic: VC is a competitive industry like any other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324257350406148))
1
- 11/ The alternative is compelling: access to community capital that derisks businesses by creating meaningful network effects.
  Bored Ape Yacht Club is sitting on a 9-figure warchest. Bootstrapped. No VC.
  For many, this represents an upgrade from traditional financing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324258445176836))
1
- 12/ But implying that VC simply doesn‚Äôt have a place in web3, or that its incentives are universally incompatible, doesn‚Äôt leave room for innovators who need that institutional capital for a real shot at success.
  If you‚Äôre building today, keep your options on the table. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324259510472709))
1
- 13/ OK. Now that we‚Äôve established nuance (on Twitter, no less), let‚Äôs answer the question: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324260521390080))
1
- 14/ Who owns web3?
  Developers
  Miners
  Startups
  VCs/investors
  Users
  In short, everyone. But what‚Äôs important now is getting the distribution of ownership right.
  That‚Äôs why Jack tweeted. Because we need people fighting to bend web3 towards decentralization and equality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324261435711499))
1
- 15/ Remember: drawing battle lines and stereotyping each other isn't in the spirit of web3. We need nuanced, patient conversation‚Äînot scare tactics.
  If done right, web3 will succeed in part thanks to VC, not despite it. Much like web2, but now with better incentive structures. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324262534569987))
1
- 16/ So, what can we do to support the best outcome for web3?
  -listen
  -explore nuance
  -keep an open mind
  -encourage collaboration
  -embrace decentralization
  -manifest gonna make it energy
  This concludes today's tweetstorm. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1473324263579033606))
