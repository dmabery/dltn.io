A - 4 Writing Tips From Benjamin Franklin's Notes

1
- Benjamin Franklin’s *Autobiography* is one of the great works of early American literature. He drafted it on paper he had folded in half, writing only in the right-hand column. He reserved the left-hand for edits. Because he worked on this document intermittently between 1771 and his death (in 1790), he often returned to the manuscript with additions and edits.
  This brings me to another tip: work on a piece of writing intermittently for nearly two decades—your perspectives will invariably shift! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkb7fkdpp7nnbjp3cm3qcrw8))

- In the left-hand column, Franklin adds his own little exercise: he would write out short hints for each essay. Then, after some time had passed, he would try to reproduce the essay himself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkb7g5tcnnndvgpndxdz0y82))

    - Note: This is super smart. Imitate great writers by taking plots, facts, or quotes from their work, let some time pass, and then try to recreate an original work using their pieces as building blocks.

- I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences and complete the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.[1](https://jillianhess.substack.com/p/4-writing-tips-from-benjamin-franklins#footnote-1-139817829) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkb7j2hkc1b9g5shtmxg0r4v))
