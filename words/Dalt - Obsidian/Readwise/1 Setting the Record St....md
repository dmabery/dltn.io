1
- 2/ Web3 is pitched as a revolutionary technology and ‚Äúthe future of the internet.‚Äù
  That‚Äôs a lot of hype to live up to. Claims like that, however true they might be, open web3 up to unfair criticism.
  Let‚Äôs talk about its future, and separate facts from the hype. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706977198993410))
1
- 3/ First: What is web3?
  Web3 fundamentally alters our relationship with data and ownership on the web.
  How? By open-sourcing information on the blockchain.
  Web3 enables decentralized networks to freely interact with code, data, and contracts‚Äîunlocking novel use cases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706977924534272))
1
- 4/ Web3 also enables developers to connect decentralized apps (dapps) and user data via networks of open-source code.
  What it means: You‚Äôll enjoy integrated and customized experiences across the internet, taking all your info and assets along with you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706978637647875))
1
- 5/ The result: a fundamental shift towards decentralization. The disintermediation of institutions like banks, record labels and wholesalers. The adoption of new data structures for the web.
  But how far will we go? And what are the costs?
  Here‚Äôs what people get wrong. üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706979497459716))
1
- 6/ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs expensive‚Äù
  Blockchains cost money to operate, it‚Äôs true. Transactions have to be validated across a distributed network of computers.
  And some of those network fees are prohibitive, especially when floods of transactions are bogging down the system. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706980286001154))
1
- 7/ But we're making progress.
  -Emergent low-fee networks: $SOL, $MATIC, $AVAX, $XTZ (many more)
  -Increased cross-chain compatibility ($DOT, $ATOM, etc)
  -Ongoing Ethereum upgrades to minimize gas fees
  Web3 will eventually be supported by an abundance of affordable blockchains. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706981061922816))
1
- 8/ Here‚Äôs a fact: the majority of web3 benefits are free.
  -setting up a crypto wallet
  -signing contracts
  -logging in across the net with your web3 tokens
  -viewing public ledgers of transactions
  -interoperability of your tokens
  You don‚Äôt need a $100k NFT to benefit from web3. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706981909123075))
1
- 9/ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unsustainable‚Äù
  Validating the network today costs too much energy, period. But technological revolutions require investment.
  If we halted all progress due to energy concerns, we may as well shut down the entire economy‚Äîfrom Apple to Amazon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706982731210752))
1
- 10/ Still, we can‚Äôt dismiss these concerns. We must make quantifiable progress here, and in fact, we are. Ethereum‚Äôs deflationary mechanisms and transition to a proof of stake model, e.g., will significantly reduce consumption.
  Every day the technology gets more efficient. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706983431737346))
1
- 11/ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs insecure.‚Äù
  Skeptics are concerned: "Can my data be manipulated? Hacked?"
  Fair questions, considering we‚Äôve always been taught to only trust institutions with our data. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706984140500992))
1
- 12/ Crypto means we‚Äôre more responsible than ever for the security of our assets.
  It‚Äôs also early enough that we‚Äôre significantly vulnerable to phishing attempts and security flaws.
  (here‚Äôs a thread with some advice on the matter) https://t.co/LrRICWjwqH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706985382072321))
1
- 13/ Fact: blockchains promise a fundamental upgrade to security, simply by removing third parties from the equation.
  Centralized companies, from Facebook to Wells Fargo, hold your data behind inaccessible vaults.
  Web3 makes you the default custodian of your assets. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706986489380867))
1
- 14/ ‚ÄúEverything will be decentralized.‚Äù
  No. Decentralization offers network benefits, but can lead to too many cooks in the kitchen. It‚Äôs a perilous balancing act.
  Web3 promises a more decentralized world‚Äîbut not an entirely decentralized one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706987391139841))
1
- 15/ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inaccessible.‚Äù
  Accessibility is probably the most valid critique of web3.
  The learning curve is steep. Developers have not figured out how to mainstream skeptical users. There are many obstacles to overcome, and it is early days. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706988057972737))
1
- 16/ However, some of the brightest talent in the world is entering web3, and the ecosystem is receiving billions in venture capital with the goal of creating more consumer on-ramps.
  Web3 onboarding is getting more mainstream by the day. Still, let‚Äôs acknowledge this weakness. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706988737454080))
1
- 17/ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs niche.‚Äù
  An unfair criticism. Web3 enables broad, undeniable utility.
  -one login across the web
  -disintermediation of third parties
  -secure, instant contracts
  -stakeholder voting power
  -monetization for artists & creators
  Web3 promises something for everybody. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706989572116482))
1
- 18/ Important: Understand that the ‚Äúcomposability‚Äù of web3 will accelerate software development and innovation at an unparalleled rate.
  What‚Äôs composability?
  Composability means that web3 apps are interoperable. Networks that were closed, are now becoming open. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706990251597828))
1
- 19/ Composability means developers can take existing programs, and build on top of them. This open code and interoperability enables a multitude of use cases:
  -developing new dapps
  -modifying and improving existing dapps
  -seamlessly connecting existing dapps to each other (!!!) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706990964686849))
1
- 20/ In web2, companies such as Facebook had to bootstrap user data to build efficient algorithms from the ground up‚Äîby collecting user preferences over time.
  Web3 companies open-source that data immediately. Quality networks and recommendations can be generated in minutes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706991673470977))
1
- 21/ Web3 enables us to trust and verify. To build superior platforms. To help create the building blocks for a more democratic society.
  It is, in fact, the future of the internet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1468706992407519236))
