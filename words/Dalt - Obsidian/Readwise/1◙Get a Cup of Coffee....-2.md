  Get a cup of coffee.
  In this thread, I'll walk you through one of Charlie Munger's greatest insights:
  In the long term, the return an investor gets from a business will roughly equal the return the business itself earns on its capital. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083401697628162))

  In the book Poor Charlie's Almanack, there's a wonderful chapter called Elementary Worldly Wisdom.
  That chapter contains this beautiful nugget:

  Of all the things I've learned from Charlie Munger, this nugget has had the greatest impact on me.
  Once I worked out the logic behind it, I never looked at businesses or investing the same way again.
  And in this thread, I want to share this logic with you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083408467189760))

  Here, Charlie is comparing the long-term returns an investor will get by simply buying and holding 2 different businesses.
  The first one is a Fair business. It earns 6% on capital each year. Let's call it F (for Fair). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083409763299328))

  The second is a Wonderful business. It earns 18% per year on its capital.
  Let's call this business W (for Wonderful). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083411017326593))

  Here's how Charlie thinks about F and W.
  Each of these businesses has some "capital" in it. This is money invested into the business by its owners.
  Each business proceeds to earn a "return" on this capital every year. These are the "earnings" produced by each business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083412153987073))

  The key difference between F and W is that F earns only 6% on its capital every year, whereas W earns 18%.
  Thus, for the same amount of *capital*, W is able to produce 3 times as much *earnings* as F. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083413336821761))

  For example, if we start off both F and W with $1M of capital, F will earn 6% of $1M = $60K in its first year.
  But in the same year, W will earn $180K -- 3 times as much as F. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083414486011904))

  But that's not all.
  The crucial thing is: Both F and W *re-invest* their earnings back into their own operations -- so they can grow these very earnings over time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083415589117954))

  That is, after 1 year, F will have its original $1M *plus* its $60K earnings = a total of $1.06M of capital to work with.
  And W will have $1.18M.
  So, in its 2'nd year, F will earn 6% of $1.06M = $63.6K -- up from $60K.
  And W will earn 18% of $1.18M = $212.4K.
  And so on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083416839020544))

  Here's a quick picture of this model:

  The upshot is that F is able to grow its earnings only at 6% per year, whereas W grows at 18% per year.
  For example, here's a 30-year simulation of both F and W -- starting with the same $1M of capital.
  By Year 30, F is earning ~$325K. But W is earning ~$22M!

  But of course, just because a *business* earns X% per year on capital, it doesn't mean an *investor* holding the business will enjoy the same X% per year return on his investment.
  The investor's return will also depend on the *price* at which he buys and sells the business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083427014402050))
1
- 14/
  But here's Charlie's key insight:
  Over *long* periods of time, the investor's purchase and sale prices just don't matter very much.
  The investor will end up getting more or less X% per year -- same as the underlying business -- *regardless* of his entry/exit price. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083428201451520))

  What this means is: even if an investor is able to buy F at a very attractive price (say, a low P/E ratio), the advantage of striking this bargain erodes over time.
  So, over time, the investor's return will tend to gravitate towards the business's mediocre 6% per year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083430135013377))
1
- 16/
  And by the same token, even if an investor pays an optically high P/E multiple for W, the *disadvantage* of this steep price also erodes over time -- and the investor's return will again gravitate towards the business's wonderful 18% per year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083431800107012))
1
- 17/
  For example, suppose we buy F at a "cheap" forward P/E of 8.
  And after 30 years, we sell it at a robust forward P/E of 20.
  In spite of our low purchase price and 2.5x multiple expansion, our 30-year return is only ~9.28% annualized.
  Over 30 years, that's $1 becoming $14.

  On the other hand, let's say we buy W at an "expensive" 50 P/E.
  And after 30 years, we sell it at a much lower 20 P/E.
  In spite of our high purchase price and 2.5x multiple *contraction*, we still get a ~14.45% annualized return over 30 years -- turning $1 into $57!

  That's what Charlie is saying.
  Over long periods of time, business quality (as measured by return on capital and reinvestment opportunities) always trumps purchase/sale timing, entry/exit multiples, etc.
  And here's the math behind it:

  Here's a visualization of the 30-year return an investor gets from holding F and W -- for various entry and exit multiples.
  Red = Poorer returns, Green = Better returns.
  As we can see, it's hard to do really well with F or really badly with W. Exactly Charlie's point.

  As Buffett likes to say, it's far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.
  And Charlie, of course, played a key role in helping Buffett reach this conclusion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083459390316546))

  One point I want to stress:
  For a business to qualify as "wonderful", high returns on capital *alone* aren't enough.
  The business should also have plenty of *re-investment opportunities* -- ie, high returns on both *legacy* capital and *incremental* capital. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083460745072640))
1
- 23/
  Only then will be business be able to complete the positive feedback loop above -- ie, take its high earnings and re-invest them at similarly high returns to grow these very earnings at a fast clip. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083462213083136))
1
- 24/
  This "scope for re-investment" makes a big difference.
  Many large companies enjoy high returns on *legacy* capital. But their growth tends to stall over time -- so eventually, they only see limited opportunities for *re-investing* earnings. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083463404265473))
1
- 25/
  For example, let's consider a third business M.
  Like W, M earns 18% per year on capital.
  But the problem is: after 10 years, M's re-investment opportunities partially dry up. So, it re-invests only half its earnings (at 18%), returning the other half as dividends: 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2p7URcVgAARuF5.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083467300741121))
1
- 26/
  Clearly, M is less wonderful than W -- as it's unable to sustain its re-investment rate beyond 10 years.
  But it's easy to mistake a "type M" business for a "type W" business. After all, both have 10 years of 18% growth ahead. And predicting the future beyond that is hard! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083882872381440))
1
- 27/
  So, what happens if we make this mistake, pay 50x earnings for M now, and are able to sell out only at 20x after 30 years?
  With W, the numbers worked out OK. We got a 30-year ~14.45% return.
  But with M, our return (even including dividends) drops to ~10.04%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1399083884269105152))
1
- 28/
  Instead of $1 to $57, we have $1 to $18.
  So, if a business is truly wonderful, we can pay up for it and still do very well long-term.
  But if the business turns out less wonderful than expected, paying up can hurt us.
  So, we should be careful when paying fancy prices!

  It was during last year's Memorial Day weekend that I posted my first "get a cup of coffee" thread.
  Words cannot describe how much your steadfast support and encouragement have meant to me since then.
  Please stay safe. Enjoy your weekend!
