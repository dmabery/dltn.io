  > ***Huberman bot:*** *Task bracketing involves dividing the 24-hour day into three phases: phase one (0 to 8 hours after waking up), phase two (8 to 16 hours after waking up), and phase three (16 to 24 hours after waking up). Place particular habits at particular phases of the day in order to engage the task-bracketing mechanisms. This will make it more likely that you will be able to regularly engage in these habits and activities over a long period of time. Additionally, positively anticipate the onset and the offset of the session and reward yourself for the entire experience. This will help shift your nervous system toward being able to predict that certain things are going to happen at particular times of day.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmeprx40807qweg6q75rcytp))
