A - From CEOs to Opera Singers – How to Harness the "Superstar Effect"

1
- In [a 1981 paper](http://faculty.arec.umd.edu/cmcausland/RAKhor/RAkhor%20Task7/Rosen81.pdf) published in the *American Economics Review*, the economist Sherwin Rosen worked through the mathematics that explains why superstars, like Pavarotti, reap so many more rewards than peers who are only slightly less talented. He called the phenomenon, **“The Superstar Effect.”** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr49jc1js0708he0j9daz2q))

- In other words, in many fields, it pays disproportionately well to be not just very good, but *the best.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4b2zsfrg72fvmwjwaaeex))

- The details of his story reveal a crucial addendum that makes the power of the Superstar Effect available to most people. I call this addendum **The Superstar Corollary**, and it's here I turn your attention next. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4bq0bbt32aq9h6zeqdha8))
1
- During this research, I kept noticing the same trait in these teen-aged lifehackers: **they had accomplishments that triggered The Superstar Effect, but which revealed on closer examination to *not* require a rare natural talent or years and years of grinding work.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4cgz5tp8ebmw2kxa0wx7v))

- Yet, he was *the best* at what he did among all applicants to Stanford, and the resulting Superstar Effect earned him a disproportionate reward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4dexcrkr0efz49s9ndd7s))

- Michael wasn't alone in his success at hacking The Superstar Effect. Consider, for example, [Maneesh Sethi](http://maneeshsethi.com/) (featured recently in[Tim's lifestyle design case study competition](https://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/12/31/cold-remedy-15-real-world-lifestyle-design-case-studies-now-its-your-turn/)), who got into Stanford on the strength of having written a popular computer programming book, or [Steve Schwartz](http://lsatblog.blogspot.com/), who got into Columbia by taking on the role of press officer for a student-run environment advocacy group. Both found uncontested niches that required only a reasonable amount of effort investment to conquer, but still triggered the full impact of The Superstar Effect.

- **The Superstar Corollary**
  Being the best in a field makes you disproportionately impressive to the outside world. This effect holds even if the field is not crowded, competitive, or well-known. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4efxy4dm5eb8r39yzv29y))

    - Note: Interesting...being "the best" at whatever it is that you do, no matter how few people do it, will net you the same results as being the best in the most populated and crowded field.

- But beyond that is the need for good stories; interesting students to talk about in promotional materials and alumni magazines. Students who will make campus more exciting simply because they are there. Students who won’t join an investment bank or consulting firm upon graduation because that is the traditional way of “making it”. Michael is one of these interesting students. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4gpzpjnmtdt3yw5c33wsp))

- Michael has two abstract traits that all selective admissions offices travel the world to find: passion and an ability to take advantage of opportunities they come across. Michael clearly cares about the environment, even hikes a couple of hours a day. His interest rings true, are consistent (common across several of his extra curricular activities and over time), and he could probably demonstrate his passion in his essays and interview. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4h0419ppdr8yrhpz5v60p))
1
- The one thing I would add to the definition of “The Superstar Corollary” is an ability to do the unexpected. The courage to do something contrary to parental, societal and cultural expectations and stereotypes, including the unknown personal stereotypes of the admissions officers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4hdr4p3bb39xy0b1yq89y))

- Imagine, for example, a programmer in a web development shop. The Corollary might inspire her to become a top contributor to some new, up and coming, open source technology. Becoming known as a world expert yields more impressiveness than if she had invested the same hours into simply working overtime on her existing projects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4k019ecav2r5ts50cg271))
1
- To give another example, imagine an entry-level employee at a non-profit. By taking on responsibility for tracking the organization's web site visitors, and then mastering enough Google Analytics to present beautiful analyses to the board, the employee will be seen as *the* technology guru of the organization — a star who is helping them understand their audience in new ways. This aura of stardom outstrips what's achievable if he had instead invested his efforts only into being a conscientious, efficient, hardworking, and *replaceable* employee.

- Writer Chris Guillebeau, from [The Art of Non-Conformity blog](http://www.chrisguillebeau.com/), provides a perfect example of the Corollary at work in a lifestyle business. Instead of starting yet another site offering generic lifehacking hints, Chris found an uncontested corner of his field to conquer. Specifically, he set out on a mission *to visit every country in the world*. The scope of this quest transformed him into a star among travel/lifehacking bloggers, and his site quickly become a lucrative success.

    - Note: what can I do that's similar?
1
- Applying The Superstar Corollary
  Applying The Superstar Corollary in your own life can be tricky. Here are some ideas to facilitate this effort. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4mqcs2hhqk8bgcvw0xadg))
1
- Idea #1: Sloganize. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4mwwct5ypzatatvvvrfpq))
1
- Similarly, in my above example of a web programmer mastering a new open source technology, she might sloganize her efforts by writing a definitive eBook on the subject. To say that she literally "wrote the book" on the technology gives the expertise extra power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4n9765bq6t9cahnvdv0mt))

    - Note: i could do this with Notion API and Next.JS. Become THE expert in integrating a site with next.

- To follow through you need confidence in your success; otherwise, your efforts will diminish over time, regardless of the complexity of your productivity systems or the fervor of the inspirational quotes you read ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4q2kckpck0d1vy6hccr84))

- In his memoir, *[Born Standing Up](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Standing-Up-Comics-Life/dp/1416553657/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1279035667&sr=8-1)*, the comedy superstar Steve Martin provides insight into his rise to prominence. [I've written in-depth about his method](http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/02/01/the-steve-martin-method-a-master-comedians-advice-for-becoming-famous/), but perhaps the most important concept is Martin's redefinition of "diligence." He notes that diligence was crucial in his rise to comedic fame, but he's quick to redefine the term away from it's standard definition of "hard work applied consistently over time." **To Martin, the key to diligence isn't the work applied to *your* pursuit, but instead the work you don't apply to *other* pursuits**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4qz9r0ggdscb432ww7bw7))
1
- The same concept applies to The Superstar Corollary. When conquering your uncontested niche, it can be tempting to divide your attention. Here is where Martin's diligence is key. The bonus reward you get for being *the best* far outweighs any small benefit that a shiny new side project can provide. On the large scale, therefore, maintaining a relentless focus on your conquest maximizes your total overall reward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4rfk3tmbe0j5pyq7j7jyg))
1
- We're wired to be disproportionately impressed with someone who is the best at what they do. This effect, however, is blind to the competitiveness of the pursuit. The writer who is traveling to every country in the world, for example, can earn as much attention as the Rhodes Scholar with a PhD in international relations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4rz35cs9v3y0k9jrxcgwx))

- Is there's an uncontested corner in your own working life where you could apply the Superstar Corollary to gain a huge return on investment? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr4s45hm893rjj48qta6map))

    - Note: good question... is there? 
      video editing?
      Reading?
      armchair science/history?
      programming?
