T - Arbitrage Makes the Worl...

1
- Arbitrage makes the world go round.
1
- This is an exclusively financial concept to most, but I like to think of it as it applies to value in general.
  What can you do for someone that they couldn't (or wouldn't) do previously?
  That's an arbitrage opportunity.
1
- The ability to spot arbitrage opportunities in a spreadsheet or a financial terminal ultimately results in the same outcome as identifying a need for a product in an underserved market: 
  Profit.
1
- Which, again - is not an exclusively financial idea.
  Reputational profit, experiential profit, informational profit, etc.
  You get something you didn't have before by spotting something no one else could see.
1
- Most people who dominate this strategy don't try and make a 100x return on their first "trade" either.
  They find small things that they can do consistently that add up to make a massive difference over time.
1
- The ability to spot and act upon arbitrage opportunities is the thing that builds your compounding advantage over the long-term.
  It's a staircase, not a jetpack.
1
- This is a stream-of-consciousness version of the opening chapter in a product currently in the works:
  The Permissionless Apprentice
  It'll be ready on December 18, and you can preorder it here.
