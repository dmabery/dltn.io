A - Innovation Starts With Defining the Right Constraints

1
- while unshackled creativity might intuitively seem to be the best route to novelty, actually some of the most innovative outcomes are produced when innovation is constrained. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401509692/16022965))

- They tell teams their innovation must cost no more than a certain amount — a figure based on assumptions about what kind solution the team will deliver. Relatedly, the constraints on risk communicate to the team: “don’t do anything too risky, especially something that might cannibalize existing business” or “don’t fail because that’s not what gets you promoted.”
  Unfortunately, neither constraint is particularly helpful in practice. In fact, they often produce unintended negative consequences by narrowing innovation to tried and tested solutions and precluding a radical reframing of the problem.

- Another similar concept is that of the Commander’s Intent. Here, military leaders give their soldiers a clear message about what needs to be achieved and by when, e.g., “we need to capture that territory by the tomorrow,” but leaves it to those on the ground to decide how to do this. Notice that the Commander’s statement doesn’t say: “you can’t spend more than this much” or “we can’t lose any men.” Instead, it states outcome and time constraints so soldiers own how this gets done and can respond as on-the-ground conditions change and enemy tactics emerge.

- First, the organization can choose to set a single, big new constraint — one that forces people to think about the problem in a fundamentally different way ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401509692/16022978))

- A second approach is to set conflicting constraints. This is where two or more seemingly conflicting outcomes — ones that appear impossible to deliver together — force a fundamental re-evaluation of the solution space. When designing what became the Lexus line, Ichiro Suzuki, Toyota’s chief engineer, stipulated that the new car needed to be faster, lighter, and more fuel efficient than existing luxury sedans. The order was full of contradictions. Making a car faster usually meant having a bigger, heavier engine; making it lighter without compromising power meant stripping out luxury that was essential for this segment. So, the Lexus team returned to fundamentals and re-evaluated their most basic assumptions about how to build a car. Alongside tens of smaller new ideas, they designed and built a first-of-its-kind aluminium engine that made the car 120 pounds lighter, improving weight and fuel efficiency, thereby delivering on a seemingly impossible demand ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401509692/16022993))

- A third approach is to specify what’s not allowed. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401509692/16022995))

- Yerkes-Dodson Law has been around since 1908. People benefit from being under some pressure because it makes them focus and work faster, so long as people believe that not meeting the deadline has real consequences — we all know the difference between a real deadline and a fake one — and provided the pressure is not so high that it triggers stress and other performance-killing reactio ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401509692/16023026))

- The first option is to set the overall timeframe and then subdivide it, structuring the overall deliverable into a series of workstreams. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401509692/16023037))

- More appropriate for organizations than projects, another option is for leaders to set big, multi-year strategic objectives — for example, a certain market share or cost ratio — broken up into quarterly milestones to gauge progress.

- A third approach, is simply to ask, “what can we accomplish in a week/month/year? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401509692/16023040))
