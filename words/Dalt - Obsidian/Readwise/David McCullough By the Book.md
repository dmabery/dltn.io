A - David McCullough: By the Book

1
- **When you wrote your first book, on the Johnstown flood, did you have a model in mind, a kind of storytelling you admired?**
  Walter Lord’s “A Night to Remember,” about the sinking of the Titanic, was the best book about a disaster I had ever read. But in an odd way I think I was more influenced at the time by the novels of Conrad Richter, and particularly his Ohio trilogy, “The Trees,” “The Fields” and “The Town,” in the extremely skillful way he evoked a sense of place.

- I wanted to be a writer, and that’s what I wound up being. The difference is, I write about real people, and in telling their stories, I’m not free to play around with facts or make things up. And again and again come vivid reminders that the truth often is not only stranger than fiction, but far more remarkable as a story. Would any novelist dare have John Adams and Thomas Jefferson die on the same day and have that day be the Fourth of July? Still, I don’t rule out having a go at a novel one of these days.

- **Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine?**
  Inspector Reginald Wexford in the mysteries by Ruth Rendell, who to my mind was one of the most compelling writers of our time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h51d8g0smpqezvxahj6rse9x))

- **If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?**
  “The Elements of Style,” by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. I read it first nearly 50 years ago and still turn to it as an ever reliable aid-to-navigation, and particularly White’s last chapter, with its reminders to “Revise and Rewrite” and “Be Clear.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h51d9g6fmrvtkh1v7xrz4myj))

- **If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?**
  Dean Acheson’s “Present at the Creation,” a brilliant, superbly written account of the processes of decision making during the highly eventful Truman years when Acheson was secretary of state. The book is, along with so much else, a great lesson in courage and loyalty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h51d9t5rfwkkpx3vdva4v53s))

- **Disappointed, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like and didn’t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?**
  I recently reread, or started to reread, Sherwood Anderson’s “Winesburg, Ohio,” which when I first read it long ago I knew I was supposed to like and did. This time I found it flat and slow, and after 50 pages or so, I put it down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h51dam2wdw6d9awe6557cnzg))

- **What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?**
  Mainly, “Middlemarch,” by George Eliot, which I’ve had every good intention to undertake. Maybe this is the year! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h51dbfygcc9ba893gx59qpcw))
