B - Traction

1
- How can you elevate yourself to a position of true leadership? ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=144))
1
- You are not your business. Your business is an entity in and of itself. Yes, you created it, but in order to find success, you have to turn it into a self-sustaining organism. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=167))
### CHAPTER 1 THE ENTREPRENEURIAL OPERATING SYSTEM STRENGTHENING THE SIX KEY COMPONENTS
1
- Successful business owners not only have compelling visions for their organizations, but also know how to communicate those visions to the people around them. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=218))
1
- The more clearly everyone can see your vision, the likelier you are to achieve it. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=222))
1
- (V/TO) to focus your people on one target and become like that laser beam. The tool simplifies strategic planning by distilling your vision into simple points that allow you to clearly define who you are as an organization, where you’re going and how you’ll get there. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=227))
1
- the two essential ingredients of any great team: the right people in the right seats. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=234))
1
- hire. They must get it, want it, and have the capacity to do it. Once you incorporate GWC into The People Analyzer, you’ll have a working tool that determines which people are the right ones and which people are in the right seats. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=242))
1
- Issues are the obstacles that must be faced to execute your vision. Just as an individual’s success is directly proportionate to his or her ability to solve any issues that arise, the same holds true for a company. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=259))
1
- The good news is that, in the history of business, there has only ever been a handful of different kinds of issues. The same ones come up over and over again. In time, you will become an expert at identifying them and knocking them down. To the degree you can identify them, discuss them honestly in a healthy environment, and learn to eradicate them, you will achieve your vision. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=262))
1
- In the bustle of day-to-day operations, most companies don’t invest the time required to adequately solve their issues. The irony is that by taking the time to address a problem, you will ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=266))
1
- Your processes are your Way of doing business. Successful organizations see their Way clearly and constantly refine it. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=274))
1
- You will not get your company to the next level by keeping your processes in your head and winging it as you go. Ask yourself: Have you documented the way you want everything done in your organization? ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=277))
1
- Vision without traction is merely hallucination. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=288))
1
- start The EOS Process rate their accountability somewhere around 4. Gaining traction requires two disciplines. First, everyone in the organization should have Rocks, which are clear 90-day priorities designed to keep them focused on what is most important. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=292))
1
- The second discipline requires implementing what is called a Meeting Pulse at all levels in the organization, which will keep everyone focused, aligned, and in communication. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=293))
1
- The Level 10 Meeting Agenda is a tool that will help you get to the core of what makes for great meetings, namely conflict and resolution. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=298))

- CHAPTER 2 LETTING GO OF THE VINE ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=372))
2
    - Note: h.1
1
- Most business owners are unable to reach the next level because they are simply not ready to let go of the vine. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=380))
1
- If you’re not happy with the current state of your company, you have three choices. You can live with it, leave it, or change it. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=390))
1
- With the right vision, structure, and people in place, your company can evolve and realize its full potential. To be truly ready for this change, you must be willing to embrace the following four fundamental beliefs:       1. You must build and maintain a true leadership team.       2. Hitting the ceiling is inevitable.       3. You can only run your business on one operating system.       4. You must be open-minded, growth-oriented, and vulnerable. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=394))
#### BUILDING A TRUE LEADERSHIP TEAM
1
- You cannot build an enduring, successful organization that lives beyond you if your organization is designed to crumble the minute you step aside. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=405))
1
- Each of your departmental heads should be better than you in his or her respective position. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=409))
1
- As goes the leadership team, so goes the company. Your leadership team must present a united front to the rest of your organization. In ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=418))
#### HITTING THE CEILING IS INEVITABLE
1
- Reaching the natural limits of your existing resources is a by-product of growth, and a company continually needs to adjust its existing state if it hopes to expand through the next ceiling. You and your leadership team need to understand this, because you will hit the ceiling on three different levels: as an organization, departmentally, and as individuals. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=422))
1
- In fact, most companies need to start with a focus on internal growth before they can even think about external growth. The paradox is that they will actually grow faster externally in the long run if they are focused internally from the outset. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=426))
1
- If your organization needs an internal transformation first, be honest with yourself and spend the next one or two years growing internally and honing your business model so it can support external revenue growth. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=439))
1
- In a study published by the Monthly Labor Review in 2005, economist Amy E. Knaup states that 56 percent of businesses die within the first four years. And in his book The E-Myth and The E-Myth Revisited, author Michael Gerber paints an even scarier picture, saying that 80 percent of businesses fail in their first five years and 80 percent of those remaining will fail somewhere between years six through ten. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=444))
1
- Above all else, your leaders need to be able to simplify, delegate, predict, systemize, and structure. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=448))
1
- “Simplify, simplify.” Henry David Thoreau       “One ‘simplify’ would have sufficed.” Ralph Waldo Emerson ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=454))
1
- “No further progress and growth is possible for an organization until a new state of simplicity is created.” With its many tools, the entire EOS process is designed to help you create that new state of simplicity. It’s a common thread you’ll see over and over again throughout this book: Less is more. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=457))
1
- Not only will you need to learn how to delegate and elevate, but the people around you will as well. Just as you need to figure out how to build an extension of yourself, your team can also extend the company by building teams under them, thus ensuring the company’s continued growth. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=468))
1
- Long-term predicting is the forecast of everything 90 days and beyond. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=474))
1
- You do this by starting with the far future and working your way back. What is your 10-year target? What is your three-year picture? Your one-year plan? What do you have to accomplish in the next 90 days in order to be on track? ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=476))
1
- Long-term predicting is not really about foretelling what will happen; it’s making a decision about what you will do tomorrow based on what you know today. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=478))
1
- As leaders, you’ll need to stop working in the business 100 percent of the time, and as Michael Gerber, author of The E-Myth and The E-Myth Revisited, puts it, work on the business every so often instead. This discipline will get you to where you want to go faster. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=483))
1
- Short-term prediction. While the long-term view addresses business needs 90 days and beyond, short-term focuses on the immediate future. These are the issues that will arise on a daily or weekly basis, and your ability to solve them will affect the long-term greater good of the organization. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=485))
1
- Most leaders are so buried in the day-to-day grind that they’ll typically think up flimsy workarounds just to get nagging issues out of their way so they can make it to the next week. If this happens long enough, their whole organization will come to be held together by duct tape and twine, and it will ultimately implode. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=488))
1
- The first step is to agree as a leadership team on what these processes are and then to give them a name. This is your company’s Way of doing business. Once you all agree on your Way, you will simplify, apply technology to, document, and fine-tune these core processes. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=498))
1
- ceiling. There is a direct correlation between organizational adherence to core processes and your own ability to let go. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=502))
1
- Your company needs to be organized in a way that reduces complexity and creates accountability. In addition, this structure should also be designed to boost you to the next level. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=506))
#### YOU CAN ONLY RUN YOUR BUSINESS ON ONE OPERATING SYSTEM
1
- When systems work at cross purposes, your company is the ultimate loser. You cannot build a great organization on multiple operating systems—you must choose one. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=527))
1
- YOU MUST BE OPEN-MINDED, GROWTH-ORIENTED, AND VULNERABLE ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=528))
2
    - Note: ,h2
1
- After one particularly unsuccessful engagement, I reflected back on why The EOS Process did not work. It came down to a simple truth: The members of the leadership team weren’t growth-oriented, either internally or externally, nor were they willing to be vulnerable or open-minded. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=534))
1
- In summary, the four fundamental beliefs are as follows:       1. You must build and maintain a true leadership team.       2. Hitting the ceiling is inevitable.       3. You can only run your business on one operating system.       4. You must be open-minded, growth-oriented, and vulnerable. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=545))
### CHAPTER 3 THE VISION COMPONENT DO THEY SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?
1
- As he well knows, most entrepreneurs can clearly see their vision. Their problem is that they make the mistake of thinking that everyone else in the organization sees it too. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=563))
1
- Clarify your vision and you will make better decisions about people, processes, finances, strategies, and customers. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=566))
1
- “If you could get all the people in an organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any industry, in any market, against any competition, at any time.” ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=570))
1
- The first step is letting go because the vision you’re about to clarify can’t be about you. It has to define something bigger. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=580))
1
- To learn how to create a strong vision, you must first answer eight important questions. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=582))
#### ANSWERING THE EIGHT QUESTIONS
1
- What is vision? It’s clearly defining who and what your organization is, where it’s going and how it’s going to get there. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=607))
1
- 1. What are your core values?       2. What is your core focus?       3. What is your 10-year target?       4. What is your marketing strategy?       5. What is your three-year picture?       6. What is your one-year plan?       7. What are your quarterly Rocks?       8. What are your issues? ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=613))
#### WHAT ARE YOUR CORE VALUES?
1
- In the course of writing Built to Last, Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras spent six years researching organizations that have endured through recessions and depressions for decades. One of their key findings was that in every case, these companies defined their core values in the very early stages and built a culture of people around them. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=634))
##### STEP 1
1
- When you interview employee candidates, they need to hear that speech. They need to know who you are. It’s easy to find people with the right skill set, but you want the one that rows in your direction. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=802))
1
- In short, it doesn’t matter what your core values are as much as it does that you’ve clearly defined, communicated, and are living them as an organization. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=815))
#### WHAT IS YOUR CORE FOCUS?
1
- Once your core focus is clear, you’ll need to stay true to it. If a new business opportunity doesn’t fit, don’t do it. If someone on the leadership team tries to throw something incongruent over the wall, throw it back. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=912))
#### WHAT IS YOUR 10-YEAR TARGET?
1
- One common thread unites successful people and successful companies. All of them have a habit of setting and achieving goals. That’s why I am consistently amazed by the number of entrepreneurs who can’t tell me what their number one goal ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=939))
1
- This is the one larger-than-life goal that everyone is working toward, the thing that gives everyone in the organization a long-range direction. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=947))
1
- As with all goal-setting activities, your 10-year target must be specific and measurable so that there can’t be any gray areas. You ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=967))
#### WHAT IS YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY?
1
- If you try to please everyone, you’re going to lose your ass. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=981))
1
- The most common mistake that most organizations make involves competing in too many sectors, markets, services, or product lines, and trying to be all things to all people. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1049))
1
- What your leadership team has to do is determine what the bar is. The “bar” is the minimum standard you will accept from the People Analyzer results. ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1387))
1
- The recommended bar for a company with five core values is three pluses, two plus/minuses, and never a minus. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1390))
1
- STEP 1 After discovering your core values as a leadership team, “people-analyze” each other, as all EOS clients do. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1414))
1
- Have your leadership team people-analyze everyone in the organization and then have each manager share those results in one-on-one sessions. ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1419))
1
- Use the People Analyzer in your quarterly performance reviews with all team members. Let them analyze you as well. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1421))
1
- If your leadership team is struggling with a personnel problem, run the person through the People Analyzer. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1423))
1
- What is the right structure to move your organization forward in the next six to 12 months? ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1434))
1
- You must look forward. You cannot look back or get caught up in the present. It will distort your judgment.       2. You must detach yourself from the existing business, your current role, and your ego.       3. You must elevate yourself above the business, look down on it, and make decisions for the long-term greater good of the company. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1438))
1
- In the box to the left, you have the first major function: sales and marketing. In the middle box is the second: operations. In the box to the right, you have the third: finance and administration. ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1444))
1
- In order to maintain accountability, only one person can ultimately be in charge of any major function within an organization. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1463))
1
- When more than one person is accountable, nobody is. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1464))
1
- The integrator is the person who harmoniously integrates the major functions of the business. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1471))
1
- The visionary and the integrator couldn’t be more different. In a small to mid-size company, the visionary is typically the owner, co-owner, or founder. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1490))
1
- The visionary typically has 10 new ideas a week. Nine of them might not be so great, but one usually is, and it’s that one idea each week that keeps the organization growing. ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1492))
1
- They’re typically very creative. They’re great solvers of big ugly problems (not the little practical ones), and fantastic with important clients, vendors, suppliers, and banking relationships. The culture of the organization is very important to them, because they usually operate more on emotion and therefore have a better barometer of how people are feeling. If you’re one, know thyself and be free. ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1494))
1
- An entrepreneur’s lust needs to be counterbalanced with a manager’s prudence and discipline. He is making the same point as the visionary/integrator relationship, just using different terminology. When it’s structured correctly, the dynamic that exists between the two Unique Abilities® can be magical. ([Location 1501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1501))
1
- As a textbook visionary, he quickly became frustrated with the day-to-day running of the business but kept getting his hands into everything. As a textbook integrator, I wanted him to stay out of my way and let me handle the nuts and bolts. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1516))
1
- Clear accountability will take you to the next level. ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1522))
1
- What makes the Accountability Chart more than just an organizational chart is that once the major functions are clear, each is defined by five major roles. ([Location 1529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QWLLV2&location=1529))
