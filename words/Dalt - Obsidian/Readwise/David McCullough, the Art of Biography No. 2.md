- I love that story and have used it often when teaching classes on writing, because seeing is so important in this work. Insight comes, more often than not, from looking at what’s been on the table all along, in front of everybody, rather than from discovering something new. Seeing is as much the job of an historian as it is of a poet or a painter, it seems to me. That’s Dickens’s great admonition to all writers, “Make me see.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhz8mj7w8esn5ddt9byfx23))

- The red boxes were all in a row—the attacks were all happening on Sunday. I thought, What happens on Sunday? Then it began to make sense. If he had an attack, he didn’t have to go to church, which he hated, and his father would take him to the country. He loved the country, and when it was just he and his father alone—that was pure heaven. This doesn’t mean the attacks were planned. The closest analogy to an asthma attack might be a case of the hiccups—you don’t decide to have them, and yet just as the hiccups can be ended by something traumatic some kinds of asthmatic attacks are triggered by anxiety ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzb1bfcmdghsq4mmrq2phn))

- There’s another scene in *Mornings on Horseback* that I felt was crucial to understanding Roosevelt’s character, which might not be considered important by conventional standards. The family was taking a trip up the Nile and young Theodore, who was an amateur taxidermist, shot and stuffed a number of birds. So I went out and found out how taxidermy is done. It takes patience and dexterity, and it’s smelly and grubby—a kind of work that would be very difficult for a child. And if you do it on a boat with your whole family present, you upstage them all. There’s a paragraph or two in the book about the process of stuffing a bird, because I thought that would show a lot about the boy. I didn’t want to say, He was a bright boy who did things other boys couldn’t. I wanted the reader to know it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzcdrtzaz76nwy6t6hnk0x))

- The chances of finding a new piece are fairly remote—though I’ve never written a book where I didn’t find *something* new—but it’s more likely you see something that’s been around a long time that others haven’t seen. Sometimes it derives from your own nature, your own interests. More often, it’s just that nobody bothered to look closely enough.

- Thornton Wilder was a fellow at my college at Yale. Here was a world-celebrated writer for us to talk to, to have lunch with—imagine!—and he was easy to talk to, delightful. Later, while working in New York, I read the interview with him in *The Paris Review*. I can’t tell you what a difference it made for me. When asked why he wrote books and plays, he said, “I think I write in order to discover on my shelf a new book that I would enjoy reading or to see a new play that would engross me.” If it didn’t exist, he wrote it so he could read it or see it.

- read. I wasn’t at all sure how to go about it. One evening, in New York, at a gathering of writers and historians interested in the West, my boss, Alvin Josephy, pointed to a white-haired man across the room. He said, That’s Harry Drago. Harry Sinclair Drago. He’s written over a hundred books. I waited for my chance and walked over. Mr. Drago, I said, Alvin Josephy says that you’ve written over a hundred books. Yes, he said, that’s right. How do you do that? I asked. And he said, Four pages a day. Every day? Every day. It was the best advice an aspiring writer could be given.

- I never had any intention of writing except in the narrative form. I believe in the strong narrative. In E. M. Forster’s *Aspects of the Novel* he talks about the difference between a sequence of events and a story. He says, If I tell you that the king died and then the queen died, that’s a sequence of events. If I tell you that the king died and then the queen died of grief, that’s a story—you *feel* that.

- But you’re not going to feel anything by reading those. Not only do I want the reader to get inside the experience of the events and feel what it was like—*I* want to get inside the events and feel what it was like. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzmd554m0k0948a2psfe02))

- The book was really about human shortsightedness, the message being that it’s extremely risky, even perilous, to assume that because people hold positions of responsibility they are therefore behaving responsibly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhztjht0xk79t46081mm15t))

    - Note: He wrote this in the intro to The Great Bridge as well.

- Of course, I had help from experts and engineers, but my thought was, If I can make this clear and interesting to myself, then maybe it will be interesting to others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjfb0q1651escj2bgrzg50h))

- The problem with so much of history as it’s taught and written is that it’s so often presented as if it were all on a track—this followed that. In truth, nothing ever had to happen the way it happened. Nothing was preordained. There was always a degree of tension, of risk, and the question of what was going to happen next. The Brooklyn Bridge was built. You know that, it’s standing there today, but they didn’t know that at the start. No one knew Truman would become president or that the Panama Canal would be completed.

- People say, But with a computer you could go so much faster. Well, I don’t want to go faster. If anything, I should go slower. I don’t think all that fast. They say, But you could change things so readily. I can change things very readily as it is. I take a pen and draw a circle around what I want to move up or down or wherever and then I retype it. Then they say, But you wouldn’t have to retype it. But when I’m retyping I’m also rewriting. And I’m listening, hearing what I’ve written. Writing should be done for the ear.

- Do you make corrections while she’s reading?
  Yes, I make a little mark, or she does. Once when she was reading one of the last chapters of *Mornings on Horseback*, she stopped and said, There’s something wrong with that sentence. I said, Read it again. She read it again, There’s something wrong there. I said, Give it to me, you’re not reading it right, and I read it out loud and said, See?
  Well, a year or so later, when the book was published, Gore Vidal reviewed it in *The New York Review of Books*. It was a favorable review and I was very pleased, except that, out of the whole book, he singled out one sentence as an example that my writing wasn’t always the best. And it was that sentence! The only one he quoted! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjfs30a5a2n9k981t1tvpty))

- Sometimes I think I’m not a writer, I’m a *re*writer. When a page isn’t working, I crumple it into a ball and throw it in the wastebasket. Always have. Our son Geoffrey, when he was a little boy, would come out where I work and look in my wastebasket to see how many “wrong pages” I had written that day. If the basket was full, it had been a good day. I’d worked things through. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjft8gtqd51v8s7zhaafk17))

- For my current book, I want to find out more about smallpox, which was a defining circumstance of life in that era. That’s the great thing about a writer’s life—nothing is useless, everything bears on future work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjg30p9ym6b63zvvsnkaf8b))

- How do you know when it’s time to stop?
  It’s a little like knowing when you’ve eaten enough. I know exactly when it’s happening, just as I do when I get an idea for a book. It just happens. It’s not rational, not even explainable. I sometimes get the feeling that the subject picks me, as if I was meant to write each book at a certain time in my life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjg5hjed6yhmdwek6kw7sd1))

- There’s an old writer’s adage: keep your hero in trouble. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjg6hr16yf8c1zs9ts5ve4t))

- The training I had in drawing and painting has been of great benefit. Drawing is learning to see and so is writing. It’s also an exercise in composition, as writing is, though in writing it’s called form. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjg7qwmx5zk58b78ddasbs6))

- I also took Daily Themes at Yale, Robert Penn Warren’s writing course. Every morning at eight-thirty you had to slide a sheet of original prose under the professor’s door, and if you didn’t, you got a zero. There was no kidding about it. It taught us discipline, to produce. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjg93g779ppyvdbg6fq3rwj))
