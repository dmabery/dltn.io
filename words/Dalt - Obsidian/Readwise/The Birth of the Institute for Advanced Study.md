- Speculative research, the kind that is fundamental to the advancement of human understanding of the world of nature and of humanity, is not a product that can be made to order. Rather, like artistic creativity, it benefits from a special environment. — IAS Bluebook ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1556382888/21370022))

- Shortly thereafter, another prominent figure in American academia by the name of Oswald Veblen (1880-1960) was quoted in an article in the New York Times on the same topic.

- Mathematicians with a fondness for tennis (the courts were nearby) didn’t have to go home before returning to their offices — there was a locker room with showers. When its doors opened in 1921, an undergraduate poet called it “a country club for math, where you could take a bath.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1556382888/21385785))
