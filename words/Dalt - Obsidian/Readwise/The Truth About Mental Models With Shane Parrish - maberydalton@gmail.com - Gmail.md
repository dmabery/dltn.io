- “With mental models, you learn to walk by falling down,” he told me. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311978))

- The way to get rid of the bullshit and the LARPing is to honestly attempt to connect the mental model in your head to the results in the world—if you do this enough, real understanding will start to click into place. In short, just having experiences and using fancy words doesn’t actually teach you anything. You have to reflect on your experiences to generate actual understanding ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311979))

- This is a process he calls the Learning Loop: having experiences, reflecting on those experiences, and using them to refine your model of the world so that you can do better next time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311981))

- We tend to think that we learn through having an experience but that’s not how we learn at all. We learn by reflecting on an experience. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311982))

- It works in a cycle that I call the ‘learning loop’. Think about a clock: at twelve o’clock on the dial, you have an experience. At three o’clock, you reflect upon that experience. At six, that reflection creates an abstraction—a mental model—and at nine, you go on to take action based on that. Draw little arrows between them, and you can visualize this loop of learning.

- Often we get our information from people who are just giving out the recipes. Sometimes the people handing out the recipes haven’t even tried it themselves. When I’m learning, I don’t want the middleman. I want to go direct to the source.

- Well, it doesn't matter if you have some extra zeros in your bank account. It doesn't matter if you got that big promotion. It doesn't matter that you were super powerful and you ran a big company. None of that matters—you're not going to be thinking about any of that stuff. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16312095))

- What matters is: who's around you? What do people say about you? You’ll be asking yourself, “was I there for people?” Were they there for me? Did I build long-term, sustainable relationships, or did I take advantage of people? Did I live a meaningful life or do I want a do-over?
