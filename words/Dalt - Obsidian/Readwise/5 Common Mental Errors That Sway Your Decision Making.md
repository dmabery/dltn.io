A - 5 Common Mental Errors That Sway Your Decision Making

1
- Here are five common mental errors that sway you from making good decisions.
1
- 1. Survivorship Bias.
1
- Survivorship bias refers to our tendency to focus on the winners in a particular area and try to learn from them while completely forgetting about the losers who are employing the same strategy.
1
- We mistakenly overvalue the strategies, tactics, and advice of one survivor while ignoring the fact that the same strategies, tactics, and advice didn’t work for most people.
1
- Survivorship bias isn’t merely saying that a strategy may not work well for you, it’s also saying that we don’t really know if the strategy works well at all.
1
- 2. Loss Aversion.
1
- Loss aversion refers to our tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains.
1
- Our tendency to avoid losses causes us to make silly decisions and change our behavior simply to keep the things that we already own.
1
- The Availability Heuristic.
1
- The Availability Heuristic refers to a common mistake that our brains make by assuming that the examples which come to mind easily are also the most important or prevalent things.
1
- The overall percentage of dangerous events is decreasing, but the likelihood that you hear about one of them (or many of them) is increasing. And because these events are readily available in our mind, our brains assume that they happen with greater frequency than they actually d
1
- We overvalue and overestimate the impact of things that we can remember and we undervalue and underestimate the prevalence of the events we hear nothing about.
1
- 4. Anchoring.
1
- Perhaps the most prevalent place you hear about anchoring is with pricing. If the price tag on a new watch is $500, you might consider it too high for your budget. However, if you walk into a store and first see a watch for $5,000 at the front of the display, suddenly the $500 watch around the corner seems pretty reasonable.
1
- “LIMIT 6 TYPES OF CHEESE PER BURGER.”
  My first thought: This is absurd. Who gets six types of cheese on a burger?
  My second thought: Which six am I going to get?
  I didn't realize how brilliant the restaurant owners were until I learned about anchoring. You see, normally I would just pick one type of cheese on my burger, but when I read “LIMIT 6 TYPES OF CHEESE” on the menu, my mind was anchored at a much higher number than usual.
1
- 5. Confirmation Bias.
1
- Confirmation bias refers to our tendency to search for and favor information that confirms our beliefs while simultaneously ignoring or devaluing information that contradicts our beliefs.
1
- Changing your mind is harder than it looks. The more you believe you know something, the more you filter and ignore all information to the contrary.
1
- information.
1
- It is not natural for us to formulate a hypothesis and then test various ways to prove it false. Instead, it is far more likely that we will form one hypothesis, assume it is true, and only seek out and believe information that supports it.
