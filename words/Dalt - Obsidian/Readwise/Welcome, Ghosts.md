A - Welcome, Ghosts

1
- *Lost in my dreams, I somehow cross at the traffic signals, bumping into street lamps or people, yet moving onward, exuding fumes of beer and grime, yet smiling, because my briefcase is full of books and that very night I expect them to tell me things about myself I do not know.*
  *— Bohumil Hrabal* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7dj5e93n6a00hnfgp9kqa6))

- In the prolonged absence of others, our senses both sharpen and diffuse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7djxetbqg8swd83y4z8n8h))

- I am looking for the things that are not on any map of history, not in any index. Instead I wish to wonder myself with the sightings too casual to mention in written history. Historical writing often makes the mistake of focusing solely on *presence,* of what is here and why. But goaded by Zweig, I am looking for traces of *absence,* the unnamed things that once were, and are silently no longer. I want to see the ghosts.

- A shoemaker may be hard to come by today, but the ghost is the shop: how it was built, how it functioned in life. The shoemaker’s shop—any shop—has become more absent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7dppv7npxt69t061g6a5nr))

- Either way, it was not planned or engineered, but simply not-disallowed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7dsqt1wmqb6p1cs9mwrjfa))

- But we do lose a meeting-place. And we again lose the interaction of people. By degrees our space for genius grows smaller. It is no wonder we spend so much time reading little texts on little screens, like this one. It is the last easy place for minds to meet. This is our pub, do you realize?

- What are the options for a semi-retired couple *today* to do something like this? Have we ensured that seniors can still act upon this world, interact with it, in meaningful ways? I pray you understand that this is not a thought about restaurants, but people. The fact is that thousands of new barriers have made this too expensive or complex. Such an osteria no longer exists. The seniors are instead placed in homes. The place is a ghost, and we treat the people as ghosts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7dxaats855qsbkmfgqa8rp))

- These stories are not so different from each-other, or the invention of the bistro. There is a large danger in over-engineering your plan, and failing to respond to local conditions. There is great bounty in remaining sensitive to context. We understand this individually. Do we understand it collectively? Are we as a civilization still letting uses be discovered?
