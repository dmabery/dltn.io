T - 1/ My Latest Thoughts On...

1
- 1/ My latest thoughts on one of the most common questions I receive about building a Second Brain:
  How and when do I *retrieve* all the knowledge I've saved in my second brain?

- 2/ Retrieval is a trickier question than it seems on the surface, because it's not inherently desirable
  If you never encounter a situation where a given note is relevant, than the ideal amount of retrieval is exactly zero ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373324777645953027))
1
- 3/ Because retrieval takes work and energy, we want to minimize it unless we know it will be worth it
  As with so many things in productivity, our motto should be "as much as necessary, as little as possible" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373325021632815105))

- 4/ Retrieval is really a matching problem:
  We are trying to match a note captured sometime in the past, with a problem (or challenge, or opportunity, or constraint) that arises some time in the future ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373325290336702468))
1
- 5/ We have a good answer for the first part: the best time to take a note is when you're consuming it
  Especially with modern capture tools where it takes barely an extra moment to highlight, save, or bookmark a piece of content ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373325548986920961))
1
- 6/ So we're back at the original problem: when to call up a note saved in the past
  Because we don't know *when* that will happen, the critical factor is that retrieval methods have to take as absolutely little human attention as possible ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373325932899880962))
1
- 7/ It might be worth tagging, linking, sorting, filing, graphing, etc. if I know a note will be relevant in the next 3 weeks
  But if that time horizon is extended to 3 months or 3 years, and I have no way of knowing when, then even a tiny amount of effort becomes too expensive ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373326203298324482))
1
- 8/ There's another important factor: there is no single perfect retrieval system
  Different retrieval systems are needed in different situations ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373326476104265728))
1
- 9/ For example, search is probably the single most powerful one in modern times
  It takes no human effort besides creating the content in the first place, is almost instantaneous, perfectly thorough, completely random access, and searches can be iterated rapidly ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373326735022813189))
1
- 10/ Yet studies have shown that search tops out at a certain percentage, no matter how fast and accurate it gets
  This paper shows that some people some of the time prefer "orienteering," retrieving information in steps, like navigating a physical space

1
- 11/ Other technology-based retrieval methods ppl use, all of which can be manual or automatic:
  -Filing into folders
  -Linking
  -Tagging
  -Visualizing (like in a graph)
  -Sorting
  -Special syntax for searches
  -Annotating
  All of these have their uses ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373327869833744384))
1
- 12/ There's many other retrieval methods that aren't tech-centric, but probably the most powerful of all:
  -Relying on one's social network
  -Leaving physical artifacts in sight
  -Making collages or arrangements
  -Discussion and debate
  -Setting up certain physical environments ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373328267533459456))
1
- 13/ The problem is always how to enable or support as many of these retrieval methods as possible while spending as little energy as possible
  I've settled on a few principles to do that in a way that is also platform-agnostic ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373328505484632066))
1
- 14/ There are principles at each stage of my CODE framework â€“ Capture, Organize, Distill, Express
  We are taking each of these steps with ultimate retrievability in mind ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373328672090824707))
1
- 15/ Capture: 
  Save things sparingly â€“ only the best, most interesting, most relevant things that are least likely to be easily found through search, and that others are least likely to have access to ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373328872226185216))
1
- 16/ Organize:
  Take a single action to move (or tag) a note according to the most concrete, most short term way it's likely to be used (which is usually a project)
  More than one action would take too much time/energy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373329143144669190))
1
- 17/ Distill:
  Later, when preparing to put a note into action, identify the main points so that 1) You are familiar with their contents, 2) You can pick them up and move them easily, 3) You can minimize your switching costs from one idea to another ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373329494266707968))
1
- 18/ Express:
  Share your thoughts/ideas/knowledge as early, often, and widely as possible
  The collective social brain is so much more powerful than even the smartest person, all you have to do is build your own Second Brain just enough to gain access to it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373329881816207362))
1
- 19/ The feedback, reactions, and contributions that come back to you from that shared knowledge gets captured back as fuel to start the process anew
  Over time an increasing percentage of the knowledge you acquire comes through the collective hivemind, which is ideal ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373330194824499200))
1
- 20/ So back to our original question:
  The "how and when" of retrievability depends on the situation, so your goal should be to have as many retrieval methods at your disposal, not specialize in just one or a few ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373330404015411204))
1
- 21/ Ppl naturally do this:
  They start with a Google search, pivot to visual scanning of the search results, click one and do another search for a specific term, copy the link and send to a friend to discuss, share it on Twitter, save it to their notes & add annotations... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373330775026798598))
1
- 22/ I think ppl tend to think this approach is inefficient or wrong, and force themselves to follow some rigid retrieval routine
  This might work in the short term, or for very specialized fields, but it's incredibly fragile and will break sooner or later ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373331008309788674))
1
- 23/ This is why it's so important to have tech-agnostic methods for managing knowledge. Every time I've relied on a specific functionality I've been burned
  Companies get acquired, features get discontinued, technology advances and replaces human effort with automation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373331276506173445))
1
- 24/ And most importantly of all, the specialized retrieval features work much better if you've done some pre-curation
  They are complementary to each other ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373331777641607171))
1
- 25/ Every year a task that I previously had to do manually gets automated
  But since I'm always just reading and highlighting and creating what I would have anyway, I'm pleasantly surprised instead of devastated to see all my previous effort gone to waste ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373331925641744387))
1
- 26/ So to answer the original question, imagine multiple retrieval methods like overlapping circles in a Venn diagram:
  1. Search
  2. Sorting (by title, date created, etc.)
  3. Filing (usually by project)
  4. Scanning (titles, images, headings)
  5. Summarizing (within a note) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373333076370067458))
1
- 27/ Your job is to use as many of these as you need, pivot between them fluidly, and avoid or postpone as much heavy lifting as possible
  You search your Second Brain much like you search Google search results, but now you know everything is curated by you ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373333316493963266))
1
- 28/ To be concrete, you might start by looking through a project folder (or tag), you see an interesting term, pivot to searching for that term, move all the notes that contain it to a new page or folder, summarize all of them, extract the main points into a new note ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373333637781884931))
1
- 29/ That process describes how I start creating anything, from a blog post to a new course to planning our wedding to buying a car to getting health insurance
  It is an informal, iterative, improvisational, hacker way of assembling packets of knowledge just in time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373333953822613507))
1
- 30/ Ironically, it is also how I observe people working with information anyway. Finding shortcuts, going around problems, taking the path of least resistance
  They think there's some other, more efficient, structured way of doing it, and there isn't
  The natural way is the best ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1373334309084352514))
