A - The Running Novelist

1
- I was more interested in having finished the book than in whether or not it would ever see the light of day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gstjv6v7en0cd9x6dkc0fhxa))

- If, having committed, I failed, I could accept that. But I knew that if I did things halfheartedly and they didn’t work out I’d always have regrets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gstjyv0g89r6767mgfn0fa6h))

- As a form of exercise, running has a lot of advantages. First of all, you don’t need someone to help you with it; nor do you need any special equipment. You don’t have to go to any particular place to do it. As long as you have a pair of running shoes and a good road you can run to your heart’s content.

- At school I had never much cared for gym class or Sports Day, since these involved activities that were forced on me from above. But whenever I was able to do something I liked to do, when I wanted to do it, and the way I wanted to do it, I’d give it everything I had.

- If something interested me, and I could study it at my own pace, I was reasonably efficient at acquiring knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvk622fnen1yc9a1nraekar))

- The best thing about becoming a professional writer was that I could go to bed early and get up early. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvk6amdq02vrxdf4jqf26q6))

- In my new, simple, regular life, I got up before 5 A.M. and went to bed before 10 P.M. Different people are at their best at different times of day, but I’m definitely a morning person. That’s when I can focus. Afterward, I work out or do errands that don’t take much concentration. At the end of the day, I relax, read, or listen to music. Thanks to this pattern, I’ve been able to work efficiently now for twenty-seven years. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvk8nxw4sh474nepdn26rgm))

- But, at that point, I felt that the indispensable relationship I should build in my life was not with a specific person but with an unspecified number of readers. My readers would welcome whatever life style I chose, as long as I made sure that each new work was an improvement over the last.

- So, like eating, sleeping, housework, and writing, running was incorporated into my daily routine. As it became a natural habit, I felt less embarrassed about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvkbafp86x852r73jfbe968))

- When I think about it, having the kind of body that easily puts on weight is perhaps a blessing in disguise. In other words, if I don’t want to gain weight I have to work out hard every day, watch what I eat, and cut down on indulgences. People who naturally keep the weight off don’t need to exercise or watch their diet. Which is why, in many cases, their physical strength deteriorates as they age.

- If someone has an interest in long-distance running, he’ll start running on his own. If he’s not interested in it, no amount of persuasion will make any difference. Marathon running is not a sport for everyone, just as being a novelist isn’t a job for everyone. Nobody ever recommended or even suggested that I be a novelist—in fact, some tried to stop me. I simply had the idea to be one, and that’s what I did. People become runners because they’re meant to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvkgnxdrx32gsj9xbkjg2k9))

- Now, whenever I feel like I don’t want to run, I always ask myself the same thing: You’re able to make a living as a novelist, working at home, setting your own hours. You don’t have to commute on a packed train or sit through boring meetings. Don’t you realize how fortunate you are? Compared with that, running an hour around the neighborhood is nothing, right?

- At any rate, this is how I started running. Thirty-three—that’s how old I was then. Still young enough, though no longer a young man. The age that Jesus Christ died. The age that F. Scott Fitzgerald started to go downhill. It’s an age that may be a kind of crossroads in life. It was the age when I began my life as a runner, and it was my belated, but real, starting point as a novelist. ? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvkk809h2qct8235jct4cgs))
