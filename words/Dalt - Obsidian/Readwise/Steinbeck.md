- ideas conceived in multitudes and dying as they were born. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=64))
1
- It is the record of a questing, weighing, synthesizing, creating mind that never rested—that resented rest, except the kind of rest he found in work. But chiefly and always, it is the record of a man learning his craft. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=64))
1
- And the letter-writing habit, ingrained over the years, became at last inseparable from the work itself. It was his way of warming up: mornings, before he started work, he got the juices flowing by writing letters. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=73))
1
- “I sharpen all the pencils in the morning and it takes one more sharpening for a day’s work. That’s twenty-four sharp points. I can make a newly sharpened pencil last almost a page.” ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=79))
1
- He himself had told a friend, “There is a difference between writing letters and answering them.” ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=116))
1
- On the other hand, when he was considering the publication of a diary that was later issued posthumously as Journal of a Novel, ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=127))
1
- “I want to speak particularly of your theory of clean manuscript and spelling as correct as a collegiate stenographer and every nasty little comma in its place and preening of itself. I have the instincts of a minstrel rather than those of a scrivener. When my sounds are all in place, I can send them to a stenographer who knows his trade and he can slip the commas about until they sit comfortably and he can spell the words so that school teachers will not raise their eyebrows when they read them. Why should I bother?” ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=139))
1
- Don’t tell any one I am afraid. I do not like to be suspected of being afraid. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=190))
1
- There is something so nice about being able to put down a sentence and then look it over and then change it, sometimes taking half an hour over two lines. And it is possible here because there seems to be no reason for rush. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=198))
1
- Already it was clear that the most important thing in his life, the driving force, was literature—reading whatever he could, struggling to master language, testing and straining at high-flown imagery and dramatic attitudinizing—what he himself called “distinguished writing.” ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=233))
1
- Today was a long day, the hours went by so slowly that I thought of many things and finally went into a mental sleep. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=238))
1
- I think more effective than his others; some short stories by Katherine Fullerton Gerould, and she certainly is the master of her kind of short stories. I have just finished the autobiography of Casanova and The Judge by Rebecca West which is a wonderful piece of writing. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=279))
1
- I finished my novel and let it stand for a while, then read it over. And it was no good. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=315))
1
- I have a new novel preparing but preparing very slowly. I am not quick about such things. They must roll about in my mind for an age before they can be written. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=322))
1
- I am twenty-six and I am not young any more. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=343))
1
- It is an awful lot of work to write a novel. You know that because you have done it. I have been working on the present one nearly a year and have not completed it. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=403))
1
- There was every excuse for the first being bad, because it was the first I ever did but I lack that excuse now. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=408))
1
- Ted, I swear to God that if I ever finish this novel I shall take to writing the tritest kind of plot stories or even true confessions. This is so damned hard. I have never worked so hard in my life and I don’t seem to be getting ahead much. I don’t know when this will be finished. There are about three hundred and twenty-five pages done and about seventy-five to do, and I want to let it rest for a while when I get it finished so that I can stand off and get some perspective on it. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=418))
1
- I have mistresses I have never met. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=431))
1
- And that’s all. Write to me soon. jawn ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=433))
1
- I think I shall write some very good books indeed. The next one won’t be good nor the next one, but about the fifth, I think will be above the average. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=446))
1
- I dream about it. I can’t enjoy a party because it is not done. I write two pages and destroy three. It is over-ambitious I think. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=458))
1
- A novel doesn’t stop at all when your pen is away. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=479))
1
- Bad as novels are, they do regulate our lives and give us a responsibility. While this book was being written I felt that I was responsible for someone. If I stopped, the characters died. But now it is finished and the words of it are being put down in nice black letters on nice white paper, and the words are spelled correctly and the punctuation is sitting about in proper places, and most of the foolishness has been left on other sheets with blue marks through it. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=573))
1
- Dear Ted: I have received Farrar’s rejection of my manuscript. It is terse and to the point. The man makes no bones about his rejection and I like that. But now that I have it, I do not know what to do next. I know nothing whatever about the market. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=590))
1
- You are to remember that we can always put you up. I don’t imagine you want to live here but it is a good place. I have uncovered an unbelievable store of energy in myself. The raps of the last couple of years, i.e. the failure of the Cup, and the failure of my other things to make any impression, seem to have no effect on my spirit whatever. For that reason, I have high hopes for myself. Of course, the hundred page ms. flopped heavily. Just now I am busy on another one. Eventually I shall be so good that I cannot be ignored. These years are disciplinary for me. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=636))
2
    - Note: 'so vood cant be ignored.' wonder if steve martin got tgat saying from him?
1
- I retorted, “I take everything I write seriously; unless one does take his work seriously there is very little chance of its ever being good work.” And the whole company was a little ashamed of me as though I had three legs or was an albino. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=652))
1
- As long as I can work I shall be happy (except during moments of reflection) regardless of the quality of the work. That is a curious thing but true. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=658))

    - Note: Focus on the effort not the results
1
- Precious things make beautiful flames. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=662))
1
- It is quite obvious that people do not want to buy the things I have been writing. Therefore, to make the money I need, I must write the things they want to read. In other words, I must sacrifice artistic integrity for a little while to personal integrity. Remember that when this manuscript makes you sick. And remember that it makes me a great deal sicker than it does you. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=683))
1
- I don’t feel like writing. I’ve been writing all day. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=716))
1
- A man’s best work is done when he is fighting to make himself heard, not when swooning audiences wait for his paragraphs. An elevated train two doors away can have far more to do with a fine book than advance royalties or “an eager printer’s boy waiting in the hall.” If you don’t want to fight them you shouldn’t be writing. One can force attention by making one’s work superb. Only practice can do that. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=724))
1
- I’m twenty-nine today, and I haven’t thought enough things or done enough things to be that old. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=743))
1
- I have been filled with a curious cloying despair. I haven’t heard a word from any of my manuscripts for over three months. It is nerve wracking. I would welcome rejections far more than this appalling silence. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=769))
1
- I know it is hard to write when you don’t know what I want to know. Rejection follows rejection. Haven’t there ever been encouraging letters? Perhaps an agent with a thorough knowledge of markets would see that the mss. were not marketable at all and would return them on that ground. You see the haunting thought comes that perhaps I have been kidding myself all these years, myself and other people—that I have nothing to say or no art in saying nothing. It is two years since I have received the slightest encouragement and that was short lived. I ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=812))
1
- Thank you for your letter. I am sorry I must answer it from memory; Tillie Eulenspiegel, the Airedale, has puppies, as sinful a crew as ever ruined rugs. Four of them found your letter and ate all of it but the address. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=850))
1
- Life goes on here. I continue writing even more than usual. At my death, my estate will consist of many bales of paper, most of it written only on one side. It should be worth a pretty sum. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=884))
1
- I feel very sad. It is the feeling of impending doom when one is comfortable and in health. I guess it is an apprehension of the jealous gods. One can’t be as happy as I have been for very long. There’s a law against it. I have worked hard and enjoyed my work and it is the punishment of man to hate his work. Sooner or later I will have work that I hate. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=900))
1
- I learn that all of my manuscripts have been rejected three or four times since I last heard. It is a nice thing to know that so many people are reading my books. That is one way of getting an audience. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=929))
1
- A constant practice of it leaves one no material for introspection. If my characters are sad or happy I reflect their emotions. I have no personal nor definitive emotions of my own. Indeed, ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=959))
1
- Carol is probably going to work next week. [Her advertising agency had closed.] She looks forward to it. It is not good for her to be housed here with me all day. I am too impatient of movements or noise in the house. And it is such a small house. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=961))
1
- They cost our amusement quota for this month but are worth it. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=971))
2
    - Note: Budget?
1
- It’s nice to have things like ducks. We won’t ever have to feed them for there are bugs enough in the garden to keep them going. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=973))
1
- You never saw anything so beautiful in all the greenness of our garden as these luxurious ducks. ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=974))
1
- have had a couple of fallow days—absolute disgust and lack of faith in my own work and inability to go on. This nearly always happens when a book is nearly done. I shall force it this morning. And the story I am working on charms me more than any of the others. I wish to heaven you could read these things. I need a little encouragement I guess. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=975))
1
- Read 25 by Beverly Nichols ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=982))
1
- Also I was flat broke and had no way of finishing my ms. So I sold the ducks to buy paper for the stories. I wish the stories were as beautiful as the ducks. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=988))

    - Note: Noooo :(
1
- The Pastures of Heaven I sent off last Saturday. It should be there by the time you receive this. If the reader will take them for what they are, and will not be governed by what a short story should be (for they are not short stories at all, but tiny novels) then they should be charming, but if they are judged by the formal short story, they are lost before they ever start. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1017))
2
    - Note: What does he mean by that?
1
- I am extremely anxious to hear the judgment because of anything I have ever tried, I am fondest of these and more closely tied to them. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1020))
1
- I should have gone on working for twenty years, but I must admit a little encouragement is a lifting thing for the spirit. I am about a third finished with the first draft of the new version of the Unknown God. I think I like it pretty well this time. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1121))
1
- He customarily used a ledger for his writing. Sometimes this contained the manuscript itself and other times notes which preceded the day’s work, and which he called his “daybook” or his “workbook. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1166))
1
- This ledger of The Unknown God also marks the first time he directed the entire concept and approach of his work, not to a faceless and generalized audience, but to a single person. It would be his practice for the rest of his life. ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1174))
2
    - Note: Im not sure what this means
1
- I have never been able to give you a present that cost any money. It occurs to me that you might accept a present that cost me a hell of a lot of work. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1181))
1
- For I do not write easily. Three hours of writing require twenty hours of preparation. Luckily I have learned to dream about the work, which saves me some working time. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1182))
1
- Now as always—humility and terror. Fear that the working of my pen cannot capture the grinding of my brain. It is so easy to understand why the ancients prayed for the help of a Muse. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1184))
1
- May I be honest; may I be decent; may I be unaffected by the technique of hucksters. If invocation is required, let this be my invocation—may I be strong and yet gentle, tender and yet wise, wise and yet tolerant. May I for a little while, only for a little while, see with the inflamed eyes of a God. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1188))
1
- It was much more important to us that she be alive than that people like Hearst and Cornelius Vanderbilt foul up the planet. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1216))
2
    - Note: What was bis problem with thiose dudes
1
- I notice that a number of reviewers (what lice they are) complain that I deal particularly in the subnormal and the psychopathic. If said critics would inspect their neighbors within one block, they would find that I deal with the normal and the ordinary. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1242))
1
- Of course I could use the typewriter. For the first time in one solid month it is idle. This is a good day. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1251))
1
- I know a French boy who started a haberdashery just before the crash. On all sides of him stores went under but he continued merrily. I went to see him the other day and asked him how he did it. He said, “I come from French peasant stock. We waste nothing. I have very little overhead. Such things as ‘service’ and luxury are killing my competition. If I make a dollar it is my dollar.” ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1262))
1
- We are very happy. I need a dog pretty badly. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1270))
1
- But I do need a dog. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1274))
1
- I am badly needed here and I have no regrets about that except that my work seems to be at a standstill. I spend about eight hours a day in the hospital. Thought I would take my little pad and work there, but the tiny scratching of the pen is irritating to the patient. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1306))
1
- Anyone can write when the situation is propitious. I’d like to prove to myself that I can write in any circumstance. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1325))
1
- There doesn’t seem to be anything more to say. bye ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1336))
1
- This is not a letter to read unless you have so much time that you just don’t care. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1344))
1
- I just want to talk and there is no one to talk to. Out of the all encircling good came a theme finally. I knew it would. Until you can put your theme in one sentence, you haven’t it in hand well enough to write a novel. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1344))
1
- one puts down endless observations, questions and remarks. The number grows and grows. Eventually they all seem headed in one direction and then they whirl like sparks out of a bonfire. And then one day they seem to mean something. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1347))

    - Note: The best explanation of why i take notes journal and blog
1
- When they do, it is the most exciting time in the world. I have three years of them and only just now have they taken a direction. Suddenly they are all of one piece. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1349))
1
- The fascinating thing to me is the way the group has a soul, a drive, an intent, an end, a method, a reaction and a set of tropisms which in no way resembles the same things possessed by the men who make up the group. These groups have always been considered as individuals multiplied. And they are not so. They are beings in themselves, entities. Just as a bar of iron has none of the properties of the revolving, circling, active atoms which make it up, so these huge creatures, the groups, do not resemble the human atoms which compose them. ([Location 1384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1384))
1
- Why the individual is incapable of understanding the nature of the group. That is why publishing is unsure, why elections are the crazy things they are. We only feel the emotions of the group beast in times of religious exaltation, in being moved by some piece of art which intoxicates us while we do not know what it is that does it. Are you as nuts as I am now? ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1404))
1
- One piece of advice I can offer, and that is that you should never let any one suggest anything about your story to you. If you don’t know more about your character and situation than anyone else could, then you aren’t ready to write your story anyway. It is primarily a lonely craft and must be accepted as such. If you eliminate that loneliness of approach, you automatically eliminate some of the power of the effect. I don’t know why that is. ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1527))
1
- I can’t get much of any work done, and the few words I do put down are written in the midst of constant interruptions. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1553))
1
- I work because I know it gives me pleasure to work. It is as simple as that and I don’t require any other reasons. I am losing a sense of self to a marked degree and that is a pleasant thing. A couple of years ago I realized that I was not the material of which great artists are made and that I was rather glad I wasn’t. And since then I have been happier simply to do the work and to take the reward at the end of every day that is given for a day of honest work. I grow less complicated all the time and that is a joy to me. The forces that used to tug in various directions have all started to pull in one. I have a book to write. I think about it for a while and then I write it. There is nothing more. ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1573))
1
- A human body that was all dead except for a tiny flickering light that comes on and then seems to go out and then flickers on again. Our life has been uprooted of course, but that doesn’t matter if I can find my escape in work. ([Location 1587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1587))
1
- Death I can stand but not this slow torture wherein a good and a strong man tears off little shreds of himself and throws them away.” ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1605))
1
- I’m glad you like the book [To a God Unknown]. The overthrow of personal individual character and the use of the Homeric generalized symbolic character seems to bother critics although a little study of the Bible or any of the writers of antiquity would show that it is not very revolutionary. The cult of so called realism is a recent one, and anyone who doesn’t conform is looked on with suspicion. On the moral side—our moral system came in about two hundred years ago and will be quite gone in 25 more. ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1614))
1
- Dad doesn’t like characters to swear. But if I had taken all the writing instructions I’ve been given, I would be insane. I try to write what seems to me true. If it isn’t true for other people, then it isn’t good art. But I’ve only my own eyes to see with. I won’t use the eyes of other people. And as long as we can eat and write more books, that’s really all I require. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1621))
1
- In fact as an organism I am so simple that I want to be comfortable and comfort consists in—a place to sleep, dry and fairly soft, lack of hunger, almost any kind of food, occasional loss of semen in intercourse when it becomes troublesome, and a good deal of work. These constitute my ends. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1673))
1
- The work is necessary since from it springs all the other things. A lack of work for a while and the gases concentrate and become solids and out of the solids a me comes into being and I am uncomfortable when there is a me. ([Location 1682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1682))
1
- I hope this letter does not depress you. It is common that anything which is not optimistic is pessimistic. I am pegged as a pessimistic writer because I do not see the millenium coming. ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1706))
1
- There is a cycle in the life of a man but there is no ending in the life of Man. I tried to indicate this by stopping on a high point, leaving out any conclusion. ([Location 1780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1780))
1
- The talk, and the book is about eighty percent dialogue, is what is usually called vulgar. I have worked along with working stiffs and I have rarely heard a sentence that had not some bit of profanity in it. And in books I am sick of the noble working man talking very like a junior college professor. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1783))

- But I am pleased with Not in a Day. Don’t let it make a slave of you. I mean, if it sells well, people will want another just like it, and don’t let them have it. For right at that point of capitulation is the decision whether the public is going to rule you or you your public.

- have all the vices in a very mild way except that of narcotics, unless coffee and tobacco are classed as narcotics. I have been in jail once for a night a long time ago, a result of a combination of circumstance, exuberance and a reasonable opinion that I could lick a policeman.

- Nearly every man uses it individually, but it has universal rules. It is not grammatical error but a highly developed speech form. The use of the final g in ing is tricky, too. The g is put on for emphasis and often to finish a short hard sentence. It is sometimes used for purpose of elision but not always. Certain words like “something” rarely lose the final g or if they do, the word becomes “somepin” or “somepm.” A man who says thinkin’ will say morning if it comes on the end of a sentence. I tell you these things so you will understand why, in one sentence having two present participles, one g will be there and the other left off. This is a pretty carefully done ms. If you will read such a sentence over, aloud, you will see that it naturally falls that way. ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1900))

Answering the second criticism that the book would be attacked by both sides, I thoroughly anticipated such attack in trying to do an unbiased book. And if attack has ever hurt the sale of a book I have yet to hear of it. ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1938))

- They postulate either an ideal communist or a thoroughly damnable communist and neither side is willing to suspect that the communist is a human, subject to the weaknesses of humans and to the greatnesses of humans.

- If the fools would only change the name from Communist to, say, American Liberty Party, their principles would probably be embraced overnight. ([Location 1945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QWFYDY&location=1945))
