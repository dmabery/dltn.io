  IT not a curious fact that in a world
  steeped in irrational hatreds which
  threaten civilization itself, men and
  women-old and young-detach
  them-
  selves wholly or partly from the angry
  current of daily life to devote themselves
  to the cultivation of beauty, to the exten-
  sion ofknowledge, to the cure of disease,
  to the amelioration of suffering, just as
  though fanatics were not simultaneously
  engaged in spreading pain, ugliness, and
  suffering? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf5szd1kh7p4scfqg7yxvp7))

- From a practical
  point of view, intellectual and spiritual
  life is, on the surface, a useless form of
  activity, in which men indulge because
  they procure for themselves greater satis-
  factions than are otherwise obtainable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf5tq0pzdgw63p36v5x0056))

    - Note: People do things that make them feel good, even if it doesn't seem to be useful in any way. That's why some people like to use their brains and explore things that are spiritual, even though it doesn't help them get anything practical in return.

- In this paper I shall concern myself with
  the question of the extent to which the
  pursuit ofthese uselesssatisfactions proves
  unexpectedly the source from which un-
  dreamed-of utility is derived. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf5v92a3vd9n0wc2s30b9r7))

- We may look at this question from two
  points of view: the scientific and the
  humanistic or spiritual. Let us take the
  scientific first.
  I recall a conversation
  which I had some years ago with Mr.
  George Eastman on the subject of use.

  out the whole history of science most of
  the really great discoveries which had
  ultimately proved to be beneficial to
  mankind had been made by men and
  women who were driven not by the de-
  sire to be useful but merely the desire to
  satisfy their curiosity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h69qzd9xjp8m74tv518d8bqf))

- Professor Clerk Maxwell, who in 1865
  carried out certain abstruse and remote
  calculations in the field of magnetism
  and electricity. Maxwell reproduced
  his abstract equations in a treatise pub-
  lished in 1873. At the next meeting of
  the British Association Professor H.]. S.
  Smith ofOxford declared that 'no mathe-
  matician can turn over the pages of these
  volumes without realizing that they con-
  tain a theory which has already added
  largely to the methods and resources of
  pure mathematics.'
  Other discoveries
  supplemented Maxwell's theoretical work
  during the next fifteen years. Finally in
  1887 and 1888 the scientific problem still
  remaining-the
  detection and demon-
  stration of the electromagnetic waves
  which are the carriers of wireless signals
  -was solved by Heinrich Hertz, a worker
  in Helmholtz's laboratory
  in Berlin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf66bsq6pfhrfrhe3ehs73h))
1
- The mention of Hertz's name recalled
  to Mr. Eastman the Hertzian waves, and I
  suggested that he might ask the physicists
  of the University of Rochester precisely
  what Hertz and Maxwell had done; but
  one thing I said he could be sure of,
  namely, that they had done their work
  without thought ofuse and that through-
  out the whole history of science most of
  the really great discoveries which had
  ultimately proved to be beneficial to
  mankind had been made by men and
  women who were driven not by the de-
  sire to be useful but merely the desire to
  satisfy their curiosity.
  "Curiosity?" asked Mr. Eastman.
  "Yes," I replied, "curiosity, which
  mayor may not eventuate in something
  useful, is probably the outstanding char-
  acteristic of modern thinking.
  It is not
  new. It goes back to Galileo, Bacon,
  and to Sir Isaac Newton, and it must be
  absolutely unhampered.
  Institutions of
  learning should be devoted to the culti-
  vation of curiosity and the less they are
  deflected by considerations ofimmediacy
  of application, the more likely they are to
  contribute not only to human welfare
  but to the equally important satisfaction
  of intellectual interest which may indeed
  be said to have become the ruling passion
  of intellectual life in modern times." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjrfpkradbpph9m4ezspwzb))

- Neither Maxwell nor Hertz had any con-
  cern about the utility of their work; no
  such thought ever entered their minds.
  They had no practical objective. The
  inventor in the legal sense was of course
  Marconi, but what did Marconi invent?
  Merely the last technical detail, mainly
  the now obsolete receiving device called
  coherer, almost universally discarded." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf66sfpm53eecfe2vbchwta))

- Lord Rayleigh, president of
  the British Association for the Advance-
  ment of Science, in a recent address
  points out in detail how the folly of man,
  not the intention of the scientists, is re-
  sponsible for the destructive use of the
  agents employed in modern warfare.
  The innocent study of the chemistry of
  carbon compounds, which has led to
  infinite beneficial results, showed that the
  action of nitric acid on substances like
  benzene, glycerine, cellulose, etc., re-
  sulted not only in the beneficent aniline
  dye industry but in the creation of nitro-
  glycerine, which has uses good and bad.
  Somewhat later Alfred Nobel, turning to
  the same subject, showed that by mixing
  nitro-glycerine with other substances,
  solid explosives which could be safely
  handled could be produced-among
  others, dynamite. It is to dynamite that
  we owe our progress in mining, in the
  making of such railroad tunnels as those
  which now pierce the Alps and other
  mountain ranges; but ofcourse dynamite
  has been abused by politicians and sol-
  diers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjrnth6xb15s6z3k1c4s8t1))

- These substances could be limited to
  beneficent use, but when the airplane
  was perfected, men whose hearts were
  poisoned and whose brains were addled
  perceived that the airplane, an innocent
  invention, the result oflong disinterested
  and scientific effort, could be made an
  instrument of destruction, of which no
  one had ever dreamed and at which no
  one had ever deliberately aimed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjrpteqgrm54qhjf2hcrt6h))

- At no period ofhis unmatched
  career was he interested in utility. He
  was absorbed in disentangling the riddles
  of the universe, at first chemical riddles,
  in later periods, physical riddles. As far
  as he cared, the question of utility was
  never raised. Any suspicion of utility
  would have restricted his restless curi-
  osity. In the end, utility resulted, but it
  was never a criterion to which his cease-
  less experimentation could be subjected. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjrk4vc5v4d03m7nx8vwhk4))

- "Ich probiere:" This might be freely
  translated, "I am trying" or "I amjustfooling."
  I replied to him, "Very well. Go on with your
  fooling." Soon I saw that without any teach-
  ing or direction whatsoever on my part I pos-
  sessed in Ehrlich a student of unusual quality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjry86mxwa9pmtqd81dd8hw))

- I am not for a moment suggesting that
  everything that goes on in laboratories
  will ultimately turn to some unexpected
  practical use or that an ultimate prac-
  tical use is its actual justification. Much
  more am I pleading for the abolition of
  the word "use," and for the freeing ofthe
  human spirit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjs1g7z7147v0k5jrz6kwj3))
1
- To be sure, we shall thus
  free some harmless cranks. To be sure,
  we shall thus waste some precious dol-
  lars. But what is infinitely more impor-
  tant is that we shall be striking the
  shackles off the human mind and setting
  it free for the adventures which in our
  own day have, on the one hand, taken
  Hale and Rutherford and Einstein and
  their peers millions upon millions of
  miles into the uttermost realms of space
  and, on the other, loosed the boundless
  energy imprisoned in the atom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjs28cphbet1z223wjpah2h))
1
- Thus it becomes obvious that one must
  be wary in attributing scientific discovery
  wholly to anyone person. Almost every
  discovery has a long and precarious his-
  tory. Someone finds a bit here, another
  a bit there. A third step succeeds later
  and thus onward till a genius pieces the
  bits together and makes the decisive con-
  tribution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjs6yqc7z8jr0n53st765wk))
1
- I cannot deal with this aspect ex-
  haustively, but I may in passing say this:
  over a period of one or two hundred
  years the contributions of professional
  schools to their respective activities will
  probably be found to lie, not so much in
  the training ofmen who may to-morrow
  become practical engineers or practical
  lawyers or practical doctors, but rather
  in the fact that even in the pursuit of
  strictly practical aims an enormous
  amount of apparently useless activity
  goes on. Out of this useless activity
  there come discoveries which may well
  prove of infinitely more importance to
  the human mind and to the human spirit
  than the accomplishment of the useful
  ends for which the schools were founded. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjsngd6nttgn8a0thenwkr8))
1
- The mere fact that
  they bring satisfaction to an individual
  soul bent upon its own purification and
  elevation is all the justification that they
  need. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjsp34g1xvhz5gn3f62r7m3))
1
- An institution which sets free successive
  generations of human souls is amply
  justified whether or not this graduate or
  that makes a so-called useful contribu-
  tion to human knowledge. A poem, a
  symphony, a painting, a mathematical
  truth, a new scientific fact, all bear in
  themselves all the justification that uni-
  versities, colleges, and institutes of re-
  search need or require. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjspt0sfjvg3bmkjt57x32j))
1
- In the face of the history of the
  human race what can be more silly or
  ridiculous than likes or dislikes founded
  upon race or religion? Does humanity
  want symphonies and paintings and pro-
  found scientific truth, or does it want
  Christian symphonies, Christian paint-
  ings, Christian science, or Jewish sym-
  phonies, Jewish paintings, Jewish science,
  or Mohammedan or Egyptian or J apa-
  nese or Chinese or American or German
  or Russian or Communist or Conserva-
  tive contributions to and expressions of
  the infinite richness ofthe human soul? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjst5jmspymas2cqrd6wbbd))
1
- Now and then a thoughtless individual
  in one of the few democracies left in this
  world will even question the funda-
  mental importance of absolutely un-
  trammeled academic freedom. The real
  enemy of the human race is not the fear-
  less and irresponsible thinker, be he
  right or wrong. The real enemy is the
  man who tries to mold the human spirit
  so that it will not dare to spread its wings,
  as its wings were once spread in Italy
  and Germany, as well as in Great Britain
  and the United States. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjsrhn9bjhcva6cp5whh645))

- Thus men with ideas enjoy conditions
  favorable to reflection and to conference.
  A mathematician may cultivate mathe-
  matics without distraction; so may a
  humanist in his field, an economist or a
  student of politics in his. Administra-
  tion has been minimized in extent and
  importance. Men without ideas, with-
  out power of concentration on ideas,
  would not be at home in the Institute. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjsy6vejkbbxmz0sacwehcj))
1
- I can perhaps make this point clearer
  by citing briefly a few illustrations. A
  stipend was awarded to enable a Harvard
  professor to come to Princeton: he wrote
  asking,
  "What are my duties?" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjszc47t7xgdke1939a46ht))
1
- We make ourselves no promises, but
  we cherish the hope that the unobstructed
  pursuit of useless knowledge will prove
  to have consequences in the future as in
  the past. Not for a moment, however,
  do we defend the Institute on that
  ground. It exists as a paradise for
  scholars who, like poets and musicians,
  have won the right to do as they please
  and who accomplish most when enabled
  to do so. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmjt39pb3hah23y8k0bqa9bm))
