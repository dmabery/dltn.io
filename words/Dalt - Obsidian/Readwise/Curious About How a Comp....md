1
- 1. 30 Words Or Less Per Sentence
  Keep your sentences Muggsy Bogues short. 
  Your sentences should focus on one idea.
  This makes the communication smoother.
  Short sentences help break down the info into bite-size pieces.
  Digestible info = Retained info ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066485372755970))

- 2. Replace Adjectives With Data
  In 1880, Mark Twain wrote, ‚ÄúWhen you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don‚Äôt mean utterly, but kill most of them‚Äîthen the rest will be valuable.‚Äù
  In Amazon's case, don‚Äôt kill them -- replace them with data. https://t.co/GGiyVUClRB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066487797010439))
1
- For ex:
  A ton of Amazon Prime Members - > 98% of Amazon Prime Members
  Common adjectives are vague. They don‚Äôt help consumers visualize the context.
  Data does. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066489499893760))
1
- 3. Eliminate Weasel Words
  Weasel words take away from the story. 
  They're vague. Boring.
  If you‚Äôre going to use adjectives -- use descriptive adjectives.
  NOT interpretive adjectives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066490447867904))
1
- For ex:
  Interpretive - We went on a long boat ride.
  Descriptive - We went on a 5-hour boat ride.
  The first sentence makes the reader guess how ‚Äúlong‚Äù the boat ride was.
  The second sentence tells them how long.
  No need to guess. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066491349590018))
1
- 4. The ‚ÄúSo What‚Äù Test
  Re-read your writing and ask ‚Äúso what?‚Äù
  Can the reader understand the sentence, paragraph, or page?
  Does it make sense?
  Does it provide value?
  Are they learning? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066492305936385))
1
- The ‚ÄúSo What‚Äù test helps you understand their perspective.
  Readers don‚Äôt want to guess -- they want to know. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066493266432001))
1
- 5. Be Objective 
  Subjective writing lacks facts and data.
  They‚Äôre supported by points of view and observations.
  Ex: I think Amazon members are happy with 2-day shipping.
  This is a point of view. There is zero proof. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066494092709892))
1
- Objective writing on the other hand can be confirmed through data and facts.
  Ex: We increased customer satisfaction by 95% with the addition of free 2-day shipping. https://t.co/E3EIhjogL2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066497062211584))
1
- 6. Avoid Jargon and Acronyms 
  Use an acronym or jargon a new customer doesn‚Äôt understand and you‚Äôll lose them.
  Your attempt to sound smart went right over their head.
  A consumer who doesn‚Äôt understand will move on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066498945511430))
1
- For example:
  Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúCAC‚Äù was reduced by 5% in Q2.
  Amazon reduced their ‚Äúcustomer acquisitions costs‚Äù by 5% in Q2. https://t.co/1rCEZexYyj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066502196068360))
1
- 7. Use Subject-Verb-Object Sentences
  Use this sentence structure to be clear.
  - Who/what are you writing about.
  - What did they do.
  - What was acted on.
  For ex:
  An Amazon Prime Member wrote a 5-star review.
  Subject: Amazon Prime Member
  Verb: Wrote
  Object: Review https://t.co/2FUM1E9G18 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1381066505656356865))
