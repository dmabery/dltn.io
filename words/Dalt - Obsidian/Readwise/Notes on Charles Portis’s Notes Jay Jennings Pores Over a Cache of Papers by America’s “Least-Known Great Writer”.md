A - Notes on Charles Portis’s Notes: Jay Jennings Pores Over a Cache of Papers by America’s “Least-Known Great Writer”

- One of the most helpful categories of ephemera for me in writing the chronology for the newly published Library of America volume was gas receipts. As I laid them out to follow Portis’s peripatetic wanderings to places like Key West, Corpus Christi, San Miguel de Allende, and New Mexico, I felt uncomfortably close to Ray Midge, the cuckolded narrator of *The Dog of the South* who does the same with American Express receipts to trace the journey of his wife and her paramour. More substantive was the material in Portis’s own hand—and from his two-fingered typing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3n3te1dkz4c22854r0j85zv))

- In particular, the notes and drafts and changes for *True Grit* are a rich vein for exploration. Early pages have the book’s indelible characters, whom I have trouble imagining under any other names, as Carrie White (for Mattie Ross), Evans (for LaBoeuf), and James Chaney (instead of Tom, which Portis changed after remembering that James Chaney was the Black civil rights activist murdered in Mississippi in 1964). Rooster was always Rooster, though in early drafts his surname is Kinkaid or Poindexter. That should put to rest any claim that the character was based on a real marshal named Cogburn. In a letter from 2000, answering questions from the superintendent of the Fort Smith National Historic Site, in the western Arkansas city where Mattie first meets and recruits Rooster, Portis said he landed on the name Cogburn because it was “Scots,” the background he wanted Rooster to have.

    - Note: CR Roald Dahl naming the oompa loompas "Whipple Scrumppets" in one of the latest copies of the manuscript. Sometines we think great artists have everything figure out before they start out, but that can't be further from the truth!

- One page headed “Changes, additions,” probably late in the writing, lists ten items to sharpen details in the narrative: “2. Frank Ross fought with the First Arkansas Mounted Rifles—see notebook”; “8. Change Rooster’s pistol to .44-40 Colt’s revolver.” Many of these notes speak to the historical novelist’s fusion of imagination and accuracy, a hybrid process addressed by Portis in his letter to the Fort Smith superintendent: “[M]y ‘research’ wasn’t very professional. If I couldn’t confirm something, or locate a particular fact I needed, I would just make something up. And something much better, too, I told myself, than the dreary fact would turn out to be. I wasn’t writing a treatise, only a novel. Still, you like to get things right.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3n416f97v0nb5mf9x153frx))

- An editor from *The Paris Review* once contacted me and asked if Portis might sit with me for one of the magazine’s well-known “Writers at Work” interviews. I answered, “I can’t imagine anything he would enjoy less.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3n44q2dw0c8a8nj1ks4nkdv))

- There’s one note that will never make it to an archive because I’ll never give it up. When his Alzheimer’s was beginning to emerge and he had to stop driving, Portis would walk down the hill from the apartment complex where we both happened to live to the Faded Rose restaurant and bar. We met there most Monday afternoons, and one day I offered him a ride back up the hill. I added that if he ever needed a lift, he could give me a call—from the restaurant or wherever he was (because he refused to carry a cell phone). Always prepared to observe and record, like every good novelist and journalist, he pulled a pen and pad from his pocket and asked me to write down my number. I did so and gave the pad back to him, and he looked at it for a moment, noticing a note he’d made there earlier, the only other thing on the page. He read it aloud, “Like housecats gone feral.” He considered the phrase briefly and said, “I wonder what that was all about.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3n45xxny5saasddbdrp2t6x))
