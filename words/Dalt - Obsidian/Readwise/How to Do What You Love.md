A - How to Do What You Love

1
- They may have to be made to work on certain things. But if we make kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more interesting stuff later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwtb1wk0c17mcny0fataxmj3))
1
- Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do? The first sentence of this essay explains that. If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what they do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwtb3x98pr3j7fz6d2xeggmx))
1
- A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwtb5sf9wx0z4yghcrj52mm1))
1
- The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwtbbcjwhvpqjhq3h6scz980))
1
- To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire. You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool. This doesn't mean you have to make something. If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least, wow, that's pretty cool. What there has to be is a test.

1
- When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwtwhj0tfmhf9fhn5y9c6fhr))
1
- Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwtwhw9gqjx6cefhp5mt37yx))
1
- That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example. They like reading novels. They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist? But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwtwjeq43tmmsj35t2w06wpj))
1
- Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll *make* it prestigious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvz76etasp0cq4vvkn44h82))
1
- If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvz7tx29ac71tmtpm3f9734))
1
- The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in, say, corporate law, or medicine. A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting to someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really like. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvz99mbbzbrgya4ptzqz9s4))
1
- The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at another job to make a living. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvz9n6j96g69909appzqcnj))
1
- The kids think their parents are "materialistic." Not necessarily. All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves, simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards. If your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzbw9vxwtvys7gxhxcc01z))
1
- Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think—because the way to do great work is to find something you like so much that you don't have to force yourself to do it—*finding* work you love does usually require discipline. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzdnwfswb0c5w5x04j5w07))
1
- Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on, when they're trying to find their niche. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzehxdrkwfey4z8pys7d1g))
1
- Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you're actually writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzfat5dyk6atkb874m19fz))
2
    - Note: a test for being in a place you "don't belong" and plan to get out of one day...
1
- Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn't mean you get to work on it. That's a separate question. And if you're ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzgpt2sn0tsm6fykj57zea))
1
- But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say "I can't." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzhjfjdsdjyy9g562ygqmj))
1
- There's another sense of "not everyone can do work they love" that's all too true, however. One has to make a living, and it's hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to that destination:
  > The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don't. 
  > 
  > The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money to work on things you do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzkfpkgmk79fyp443hf906))
1
- The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles. The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work. [[7](https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html#f7n)] The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you from architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music. If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you have more freedom of choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvznj86ftdbdhck0vvfhykd))
1
- Which route should you take? That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your lifetime) for what you want to do. If you're sure of the general area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route. But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.

    - Note: i took the orgnaic route with farnam street. i knew i'd enjoy working at farnam street, if i could only do what i want to do. but to do that, i had to grind it out for two years, making great work, not messing up, and gaining the trust of others, so that eventually, they'd keep me around and let me work on what I want to work on.

- Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzshsk9q7f3xx7szshpcse))
2
    - Note: Don't let your life be directed by a high-school kid.
1
- When you're young, you're given the impression that you'll get enough information to make each choice before you need to make it. But this is certainly not so with work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvzt80j8rcret2ksq8fjb2x))
2
    - Note: or really anywhere with life. you'll always have blindspots. the trick is, then, to decide what you need to know to make the decision and what you're okay not knowing to make the decisions.
1
- Remove them and most people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who win lotteries or inherit money. Much as everyone thinks they want financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it, but those who like what they do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwyzsf8y53xxvt0ay3art8c))
2
    - Note: the goal then, isn't to make a lot of money. it's to make a decent amount of money while doing something you love to do.
