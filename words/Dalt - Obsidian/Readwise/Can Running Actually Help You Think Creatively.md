A - Can Running Actually Help You Think Creatively?

- One [2014 Stanford University study](http://aaalab.stanford.edu/assets/papers/2014/Give_your_ideas_some_legs.pdf) found that participants experienced a creative boost after walking on treadmills. Research also supports a larger connection between exercise and brain health, since [physical activity can lead to neurogenesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5808288/#:~:text=Exercise%20is%20known%20to%20have,and%20incorporated%20into%20hippocampal%20circuits) — the creation of new neurons in the part of the brain linked to learning and memory. Exercise has also been linked to other mental benefits like [increased neuroplasticity and greater ability to learn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4410170/), as well as [better task-switching ability and improved focus](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-truth-behind-runners-high-and-other-mental-benefits-of-running#:~:text=%E2%80%9CExercise%20has%20a%20dramatic%20antidepressive,the%20brains%20of%20regular%20exercisers).

- When your brain is in a state of flow, you might find it easier to enter the creative process — something [Liane Gabora](https://psych.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/liane-lee-gabora/), an interdisciplinary psychology professor at the University of British Columbia, has spent her career researching. Gabora says creative ideas often emerge through associative thinking. When you’re thinking creatively, she explains, your brain is combining two disparate concepts to form a completely new concept, or putting a concept in a new context so you see it in a new way. For example, the concepts of “snow” and “man” are totally transformed when you come up with the idea for a snowman. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmqwk4qvp4enrwg9h25xa4rz))

- In 2010, Gabora actually [discovered what’s happening in the brain](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10400410903579494?scroll=top&needAccess=true) when you make those associations between different concepts: your brain accesses the mental encodings of each concept in different neurons, then binds them together into a new thought through a process called neural synchrony. “It’s not luck or just random noise,” she says. “It’s actually because of the capacity of your memory to form these bridges, based on this chameleon-like nature in which concepts change shape in different situations, that allows you to make that connection.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmqwkpvyeztbzmyshxb8k0tw))

- Gabora explains that the process of associative memory works by finding the correlation between two ideas — something that requires your brain to switch from the logical, cause-and-effect thinking of the brain’s executive network to the more creative thinking of the default network. Gabora says this is why you often feel the need to step away from a complex problem and do something else — like go for a run — to come up with a solution. “This more correlation-based thinking is something that comes to you more easily when your mind is not under control of your fore brain and that really logical thinking, but you’re allowed to just detach from it,” she explains. “While you’re doing something else, the back burners of your brain — this default network — will still be active nonetheless. And that allows these ideas to percolate and come to the forefront.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmqwmaf9s9s0681mmpctbp0k))

- Gabora says the most creative thinkers have a worldview that allows them to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that haven’t been tried before. That kind of expansive perspective requires exposure to different concepts, points of view, and knowledge — and time to make sense of all that information, she says. Running can present an opportunity for the brain to synthesize different stimuli, as it allows you to enter an unencumbered mental state where you can let your mind wander.

- Consider practicing creativity the same way as going for a run: You might not achieve a personal record every time you lace up your sneakers, but each step you take trains your muscles for the next run. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmqwpp3r9bmgm82fa7tkrwbj))
