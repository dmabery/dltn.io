A - Start With Creation

- Inspiration, the admixture of genius and motivation, is sometimes described as a force that strikes us after some patient lull or waiting period. This idleness is a mistake. The Muse arrives to us most readily during creation, not before. Homer and Hesiod invoke the Muses not while wondering what to compose, but as they begin to sing. If we are going to call upon inspiration to guide us through, we have to first begin the work. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1527657211/21488357))

- I think there is value in pushing learning and doing as close together as possible. I wish to learn like an apprentice with no fixed master, instead with repeated trial and sharing the results. If no teacher is found along the way, then the mistakes will be my teacher. Every undertaking is a series of questions and experiments. I believe every hard thing you do, for that matter, acts as a multiplier on the rest of your knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1527657211/21488361))

- A meaningful first project should have sufficient difficulty that there is some real chance of failure. It is in approaching the edges of our abilities that we are really learning, and often simple projects feel more like delaying things, including delaying mastery. A chance of failure ensures your hands are firmly touching reality, and not endlessly flipping through the textbook, or forever flirting only with ideas.

- Someone once mentioned to me that “Write what you know” is not particularly interesting advice, and “Write what you’re learning” is much better. I find this distinction compelling. A benefit of prioritizing creation and then sharing it is that you might inspire others along with yourself. And if you are creating while learning in public, you may find others who come along and help you. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1527657211/21488370))

- Mike (pictured) would have never stopped by if I was not working conspicuously in my driveway, every day, under a pop-up tent. But I was, and he became interested in my progress, and it happens that he has been timber framing since the 90’s. Had I waited for such a teacher—for he has now taught me a good deal—I would have never found him. But I chose to start, and he was drawn to my adventure. Only by virtue of starting the work was the intersection of our lives possible. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1527657211/21488377))
