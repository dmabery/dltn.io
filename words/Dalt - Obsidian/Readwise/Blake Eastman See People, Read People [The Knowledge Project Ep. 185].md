A - Blake Eastman: See People, Read People [The Knowledge Project Ep. 185]

- Most people don’t know how they’re coming up with these perceptions; they don’t really understand the origins of it. And when you break it down systematically and they start to see it, they get to understand [in] a little bit more depth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkmxaamyrj2rnytbf22yrms4))

- So everybody has their own perceptual lens for what trustworthy behaviors are and aren’t. So for me, I always look to have conversations or do things that are three standard deviations to the right of a bell curve. If me and you had a conversation for an hour, we’re bringing up topics that you normally don’t [discuss] with other people, which is going to create a higher level of trust between me and you. So I’m looking for more nuanced topics and nuanced areas to draw that conclusion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkmxbx5e9f6fn8knrbmjy78v))

- I’ve met with executives that have these weird things, … like “Oh, I never trust somebody who walks in the room and doesn’t shake my hand first.” I’m like, “Well, okay, so why?” And we look at it and it’s like when they were 12 years old, their dad taught them that. So you gotta understand that it’s “build trust, build trust.” There’s not this step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 [sequence]—it’s way more complex than that—but the first thing is, don’t be so outside the bell curve distribution of how someone acts that you’re just not trusted from the get-go.

- **Shane Parrish:** Do you think the biggest talkers are more dangerous than the silent type? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkmxda05t95tqnwxskqdpvsh))

- you were on a double date with your wife and you met somebody for the first time, I believe, and you were [thinking] “They’re cheating on their partner” within a few minutes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkmxh6czvbsw00kxkb185ekp))

- **Shane Parrish:** And I’m wondering, what went into that? How did you come to that conclusion? How confident were you in that conclusion? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkmxhbk8jhzasq4n9vx6vbtr))

- I was at a dinner once and I was with six of my friends, and one of my friends started complaining about his wife, and everybody else started to. It was such a cool dynamic; everybody else was like, “Yeah, my wife does that too and it bothers me.”
  And I looked at my friend. I was like, “Why don’t you just get a divorce?” And he was like, “What?” I was like, “Just get a divorce.” And he was like, “I’m obviously not going to get a divorce.” I’m like, “Well, why are you sitting here badmouthing your wives? I don’t have anything bad [to say] because I love my wife; I love spending time with her. Why are we doing this?” And immediately the conversation switches to be like, “Yeah, you’re right. I love my wife for this reason; I love my wife for that reason.” And it’s just like, I really believe—I hate saying this, but I do believe people are sheep in that regard, where there’s a narrative and if a powerful person just comes along and shifts the narrative, you see how quickly everybody else falls in line. And we’re all on both sides of this. Sometimes we’re the wolf and sometimes we’re the sheep. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkmxghyvxzxnr7zz5bt60647))

- **Shane Parrish:** My uncle gave me this test, I think it was a decade ago now, and without fail it has predicted every divorce.
  **Blake Eastman:** What is it?
  **Shane Parrish:** And the test was so simple. It was ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkmxjbz72x9n0ft5j1h5ce4b))
