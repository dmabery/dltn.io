- How to look like a genius:
  1. Read and think about a topic for a few years.
  2. Record any idea you have along the way—most will be bad or average.
  3. Revisit your ideas. Remove anything that isn't exceptional.
  4. Polish and share the best stuff.
  5. End up looking like a genius. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1382744776903118849))

  (e.g. zooming in, zooming out, trying a new approach, taking inspiration from a new field, etc.) 
  What comes to mind? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1481345662755217412))
