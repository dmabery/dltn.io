B - How to Take Smart Notes

1
- failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=128))
1
- Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=134))
1
- To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158))
1
- But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=165))
1
- It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=169))
1
- Willpower is, as far as we know today,[2] a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=172))
1
- Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=178))
1
- Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=179))
1
- Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=179))
1
- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=195))
1
- Having read more does not automatically mean having more ideas. Especially in the beginning, it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=220))
1
- That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=231))
1
- This book is for you, the good students, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understand that insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=238))
1
- The first idea lies at the heart of this book and is the technique of the simple slip-box. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=260))
1
- Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=268))
1
- Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=278))
1
- What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=295))
1
- Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=302))
1
- He realised that one idea, one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=319))
1
- habilitation, the highest academic qualification in many European countries, which is based on the second book after the doctoral thesis. He ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=328))
1
- Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=371))
1
- If we work in an environment that is flexible enough to accommodate our work rhythm, we don’t need to struggle with resistance. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=380))
1
- Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=381))
1
- Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=389))
1
- Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. In ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=419))
1
- He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=431))
1
- The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=435))
1
- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=457))
1
- Equally manageable is the task of bringing already existing notes into order, especially if half of them already are in order. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=478))
1
- Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=485))
1
- Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=491))
1
- Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=494))
1
- “Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,” ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=498))
1
- You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=502))
1
- 1. Make fleeting notes. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=510))
1
- Each added bit of information, filtered only by our interest, is a contribution to our future understanding, thinking and writing. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=581))
1
- Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=612))
1
- Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=665))
1
- Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=704))
1
- the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=710))
1
- The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=716))
1
- If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=719))
1
- Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=737))
1
- Malcom McLean, the owner of a trucking company and a former trucker himself, regularly got stuck in traffic on the crowded coastal highways. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=746))
1
- He just didn’t want to get stuck in traffic anymore. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=753))
1
- we know why they failed: The ship owners tried to integrate the container into their usual way of working without changing the infrastructure and their routines. They tried to benefit from the obvious simplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what they were used to. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=766))
2
    - Note: Same thing churches and companies are doing with online. Taking there old business mode and forcing it pnline without making the proper changes
1
- In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=787))
1
- The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=797))
1
- It is not surprising that my friend has a bookshelf filled with notebooks full of wonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=820))
1
- What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=833))
1
- The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones – and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=835))
1
- Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=838))
1
- It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless – unless you do something with them. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=842))
1
- Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844))
1
- no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=846))
1
- Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848))
1
- A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=851))
1
- The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=866))
1
- In order to develop a good question to write about or find the best angle for an assignment, one must already have put some thought into a topic. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=919))
1
- Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=922))
1
- The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, they come from the outside: through reading, having discussions and listening to others, through all the things that could have been accompanied and often even would have been improved by writing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=947))
1
- the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=955))
1
- If you on the other hand develop your thinking in writing, open questions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possible topics to elaborate further in writing. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=957))
1
- After many years of working with students, I am convinced that the attempt of these study guides to squeeze a nonlinear process like writing into a linear order is the main reason for the very problems and frustrations they promise to solve. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=959))
1
- Even though academic writing is not a linear process, that does not mean you should follow an anything-goes approach. On the contrary, a clear, reliable structure is paramount. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=980))
1
- The dynamics of work are not so different. Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and we can only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. But sometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us. This is the kind of dynamic we are looking ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=987))
1
- Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015). The ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=997))
1
- it wouldn’t have taken them long until they went straight for the sofa, skipping the workout altogether, because this is how we tick. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1005))
1
- Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1007))
1
- Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1009))
1
- predictor for long-term success is having a “growth mindset.” To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1010))
1
- Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1014))
1
- To seek as many opportunities to learn as possible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1019))
1
- the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1020))
1
- Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation. Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1021))
1
- Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1031))

- latticework of mental models” ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1058))

    - Note: Why is it easy to remember things, if i can connect them to other things
1
- While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased – a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1095))
1
- When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1102))
1
- The second is what psychologists call the mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it – completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1107))
1
- The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separate different kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere with each other. ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1128))
1
- If we proofread a manuscript and don’t manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1146))
1
- While proofreading requires more focused attention, finding the right words during writing requires much more floating attention. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1156))
1
- It is not a sign of professionalism to master one technique and stick to it no matter what, but to be flexible and adjust one’s reading to whatever speed or approach a text requires. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1173))
1
- To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1175))
1
- Oshin Vartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1179))
1
- Most study guides and academic writing teachers are trying very hard to spare you from that experience by telling you what, when and how to write instead. But they are keeping you from learning the very thing academia and writing is all about: gaining insight and making it public. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1219))
1
- As you might expect, the experienced paramedics were able to spot their kind correctly in almost all cases (~90%), while the beginners were more or less just guessing (~50%). So far, so good. But when the teachers watched the videos, they systematically mistook the beginners for experts and the experts for beginners. They were wrong in most of the cases (and only right in about a third of all the cases). Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, researchers on expertise, have a simple explanation: Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. Unlike the expert paramedics, they did not look at the unique circumstances and check if the paramedics in the videos did the best thing possible in each individual situation. Instead, they focused on the question of whether the people in the videos acted according to the rules they taught. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1227))
1
- But like in professional chess, the intuition of professional academic and nonfiction writing can also only be gained by systematic exposure to feedback loops and experience, which means that success in academic writing depends to a great degree on the organization of its practical side. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1249))
1
- Things we understand are connected, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. And deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1282))
1
- Every step is accompanied by questions like: How does this fact fit into my idea of …? How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other? Isn’t this argument similar to that one? Haven’t I heard this before? And above all: What does x mean for y? These questions not only increase our understanding, but facilitate learning as well. ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1284))
1
- Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1297))
1
- By taking into account these little insights into how our brains work, we can make sure that we will not get distracted by thoughts of what we need from the supermarket when we sit at the desk. Rather, we may solve a crucial problem while we run errands. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1323))

- For the longest time, willpower was seen more as a character trait than a resource. This has changed. Today, willpower is compared to muscles: a limited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover. Improvement through training is possible to a certain degree, but takes time and effort. The phenomenon is usually discussed under the term “ego depletion”: “We use the term ego depletion to refer to a temporary reduction in the self’s capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action (including controlling the environment, controlling the self, making choices, and initiating action) caused by prior exercise of volition.” (Baumeister et al., 1998, 1253) One ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1332))
1
- “Our results suggest that a broad assortment of actions make use of the same resource. Acts of self-control, responsible decision making, and active choice seem to interfere with other such acts that follow soon after. The implication is that some vital resource of the self becomes depleted by such acts of volition. To be sure, we assume that this resource is commonly replenished, although the factors that might hasten or delay the replenishment remain unknown, along with the precise nature of this resource.” (Baumeister et al., 1998, 1263f) ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1339))

- To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read.

- The educational psychologist Kirsti Lonka compared the reading approach of unusually successful doctoral candidates and students with those who were much less successful. One difference stood out as critical: The ability to think beyond the given frames of a text (Lonka 2003, 155f).
