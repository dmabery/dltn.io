- 90 Day Sprints: 
  How to set & smash your company goals:ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424196445937671))
1
- We've all been there...
  A quarterly meeting discussing future initiatives, we leave excited & ready to take the company to new heights!
  But, after initial excitement fades, no clear plan was set & nothing tangible happens. 
  The problem: 
  Bad goal setting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424199314862081))
1
- Without strict timelines & named outcomes goal setting is reduced to a box checking activity. 
  To work, all goals MUST be: 
  1. Specific 
  2. Measurable
  3. Attainable 
  4. Meaningful (h/t @dklineii)
  Otherwise, goals become wishes, & we lose control over results. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424202439626752))
1
- First, set the stage...
  During quarterly meetings, leaders should provide context to the bigger picture: 1, 5, & 10 year goals. 
  Next, identify issues preventing the company from inching towards those goals. 
  Each team member should leave with 3 90 day goals. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424205446860804))
1
- Why 90 days? 
  A few reasons: 
  The timeline syncs well with accepted business periods - quarters. 
  Focus wanes around 90 days, so it's refreshing to set new goals. 
  Ambiguous timelines encourage procrastination. 
  So, how do we set quality goals? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424208450060292))
1
- 1. SPECIFIC 
  Vague goals have built in safety valves as it's impossible to accomplish OR fail a non-specific task. 
  Avoid this by using names & numbers to describe goals. 
  The idea is max accountability through clarity & assignment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424211486736387))
1
- 2. MEASURABLE 
  There are 2 ways to measure goals. 
  1. Yes or No 
  2. With Numbers 
  Dealing in absolutes or numbers removes ambiguity about success -- and to what degree. 
  Not accomplishing a goal is okay, not knowing whether you did or didn't - is not. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424214590447621))
1
- 3. ATTAINABLE 
  Goals should be right at the edge of ability, but not further. 
  Consistent failure can set a negative confidence cycle that can be difficult to recover from. 
  Conversely, success improves the chance of accomplishing future goals.

- 4. MEANINGFUL 
  Each 90 day goal should move the company closer to achieving its 1, 5, & 10 year goals. 
  To be effective, clearly demonstrate direct or tangential correlation to the larger picture. 
  Seemingly random goals leave teams uninspired & feel like micromanagement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424220915519495))

- With good & bad goals defined, let's look at a real example: 
  Last year, I noticed my company had a Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) of 5. 
  Quickly, this means we're paying vendors 5 days before we get paid by customers - not ideal.

1
- In a quarterly meeting we discussed our goal of acquiring competitors & real estate. 
  Cash is required for both, so we needed a better CCC. 
  90 day goal: 
  "To lower CCC by 5 days, Barrett will call business customers to negotiate 5 day improvement to payment terms." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/barrettjoneill/status/1491424227047600128))
1
- With my 90 day mission clear, I focused because I knew the next quarterly meeting would come fast - and how important cash is. 
  We smashed the goal & currently operate at -3. 
  Providing context & quality 90 day goals improves the chances of achieving big, long term goals.
