A - How to Make Wealth

1
- If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money. [] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638050))
1
- Wealth is what you want, not money. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638054))
1
- Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can't make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638058))
1
- But money is just the intermediate stage-- just a shorthand-- for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638059))
1
- there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638062))
1
- The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers.

1
- A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want. You don't need to join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It's doing something people want that matters, not joining the group.

1
- To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638087))
1
- If you're in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638091))
1
- But you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16638099))
1
- You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That's leverage. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16641087))
1
- Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16641094))

- Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16641097))

- At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.

- If you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16641117))

- Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you're not just trying to solve problems. You're trying to solve problems that users care about. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16641133))
1
- where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16641155))

- In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416528418/16641197))
