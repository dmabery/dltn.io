A - Copy What You Like

1
- No philosopher ever refuted another, for example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute.
1
- How do you avoid copying the wrong things? Copy only what you genuinely like.
1
- It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things you're impressed with.
1
- One trick is to ignore presentation. Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it
1
- Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures.
1
- What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there's only half of it left, instead of being impressed that you're half way through? That's what you really like.
1
- Be careful to copy what makes them good, rather than their flaws.
1
- For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors. They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt.
1
- Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.
