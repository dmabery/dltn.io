A - Elmore Leonard’s 10 Rules of Writing

1
- He says: “I like a lot of talk in a book and I don’t like to have nobody tell me what the guy that’s talking looks like. I want to figure out what he looks like from the way he talks. . . . figure out what the guy’s thinking from what he says. I like some description but not too much of that. . . . Sometimes I want a book to break loose with a bunch of hooptedoodle. . . . Spin up some pretty words maybe or sing a little song with language. That’s nice. But I wish it was set aside so I don’t have to read it. I don’t want hooptedoodle to get mixed up with the story.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3p0054y9mq0w1stpkpq4bc))

- • **Never use a verb other than “said” to carry dialogue.**

- • **Never use an adverb to modify the verb “said” …**
  …he admonished gravely. To use an adverb this way (or almost any way) is a mortal sin. The writer is now exposing himself in earnest, using a word that distracts and can interrupt the rhythm of the exchange. I have a character in one of my books tell how she used to write historical romances “full of rape and adverbs.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3p115ef9z4w72yfa9qf6xx))

- • **Never use the words “suddenly” or “all hell broke loose.”** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3p1jzt54fsqxnajyerg208))

- • **Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.**
  A rule that came to mind in 1983. Think of what you skip reading a novel: thick paragraphs of prose you can see have too many words in them. What the writer is doing, he’s writing, perpetrating hooptedoodle, perhaps taking another shot at the weather, or has gone into the character’s head, and the reader either knows what the guy’s thinking or doesn’t care. I’ll bet you don’t skip dialogue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3p34hw7c48ctdwptpn83my))

- If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3p3dcrr0ze4xwva8n3vgr8))

    - Note: Basically, all the rules here are: if it sounds like writing, rewrite it. You don’t want someone to know something was written. You want to be invisisble as a writer
      It makes me think, when I read a heady academic paper, I think “who the hell wrote this?” when I’m reading a good novel, I don’t care who wrote it.
