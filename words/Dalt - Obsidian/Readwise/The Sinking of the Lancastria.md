A - The Sinking of the Lancastria

1
- The *Lancastria* was a 16,243-ton, five-decked ship that, up until the outbreak of war in 1939, had been a lavish luxury cruise liner. She toured the Norwegian fjords and across the Mediterranean and West Indies before being hastily requisitioned by the British government and outfitted as a troop ship. She spent the early months of the war ferrying soldiers back and forth from Canada to the U.K. and assisted in the evacuation of Norway before finally being called on to play a pivotal role in Operation Ariel—the name of the lesser known campaign that followed the aftermath of the evacuation of Dunkirk. The scenes leading up to it were no less dramatic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1x68gnpn12pyweq064dj7et))

- After waiting painstakingly for its escort, the *Lancastria* finally began to pull out of the dock. Yet any relief those on board felt was quickly dashed, as shortly thereafter six Luftwaffe planes descended from the skies. A minute later the siren on the ship sounded, described as “a chilling banshee scream . . . howling from the sky.” Initial bombs missed, but a series of successive bombs hit their mark, with one payload going straight down the ship’s fennel. It was fatal. The ship went down in 20 minutes. Thousands on board perished. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1x6hffsa15sfa33r8hzfcav))
