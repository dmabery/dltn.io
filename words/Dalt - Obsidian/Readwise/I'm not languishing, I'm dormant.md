- Or [Isaac Newton](https://www.exurbe.com/self-care-healthy-work-habits-for-the-pandemic/), who people have held up as an example of what you can get done during a plague:
  > The true fact (historian here, this is my period!) is that Newton did theorize gravity while quarantining, but didn’t have library access, and while he was testing the theory he didn’t have some of the constants he needed (sizes, masses), so he tried to work from memory, got one wrong, did all the math, and concluded that he was wrong and the gravity + ellipses thing didn’t work. He stuck it in a drawer. It was only years later when a friend asked him about Kepler’s ellipses that he pulled the old notes back out of the drawer to show the friend, and the friend spotted the error, they redid the math, and then developed the theory of gravity. Together, with *full library access*, when things were normal after the pandemic. During the pandemic nobody could work properly, including him. So if anyone pushes the claim that we should all be writing brilliant books during this *internationally recognized global health epidemic*, just tell them Newton too might ha ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv98jece462jg9znm59t4pb))
