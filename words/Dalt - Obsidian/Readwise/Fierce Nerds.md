A - Fierce Nerds

1
- The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified in taking the results personally.

    - Note: This is a good point. Star QBs have great genes, but people competing for grades have a more even playing field. Sure some people are naturally smarter, but for the most part, it’s even competition.

- The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will turn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the [hater](http://www.paulgraham.com/fh.html), the shooter down of [new ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/newideas.html).

- How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you succeed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes bitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this; merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some feeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn't, it at least keeps busy.
