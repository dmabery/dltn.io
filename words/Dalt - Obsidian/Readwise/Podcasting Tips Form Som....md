- 2. Video is not as important as audio, & it takes 20x as much effort to do a quality video podcast as an audio one
  Recording, editing, storing, sharing video is expensive & time consuming
  A great audio podcast is ~$500
  A great video podcast is thousands
  Stick to audio.

- 3. A podcast needs to be about something. It has to have a value proposition/purpose
  don’t bear afraid to go niche: that’s is the strength of podcasting!
  @tferriss did high-performers, which seems to be niche... but obviously it isn’t when he lands @RealHughJackman!

- 4. Short podcasts work if that’s the value proposition (The Daily), and long ones work if that’s what the host loves (@JoeRogan, highly inspired by @HowardStern who was inspired by Charlie Rose)
  What’s important is that length is made clear to the audience so they can buy in

- 5. You’re not going to get the top tier guests day one, unless you already are famous, so focus on getting the people around the most famous folks.... the friends of a friend/associates. 
  i.e. you get @AndrewYang you force @BernieSanders to show up.

- 6. if you start in 2021 & don’t have a huge audience already, you are going to have a small audience & little feedback
  You might be tempted to quit—don’t
  You will get good at it in years 2-3, & if you focus you’ll be great in years 4-7
  Just show up every week & don’t stop

- 7. Try to be 2% better every episodes. If you do that you will be 2x better every 36 episode because compounding improvement is the magic in all efforts in life: money, relationships, health, intelligence, skills, money, power, fame, health, relationships—everything.

- 8. Be prepared but don’t be a slave to your list of questions. If you want to be a great interviewer listen to every answer and form your next question based on the subjects previous answer. 
  This creates synchronicity with your guests—-you get into a flow state. That’s magic,

- 9. Don’t try and make money, try and have fun and great conversations or the first 100-200 episodes. 
  The money will come if have great conversations and you show up every week for a couple of years.
