A - Are We Still Thinking?

1
- We do not develop and re-develop ideas as we share them through the network of humanity, instead we share them by sharing a book, or clicking a button, and sending someone else’s words. Unlike Aristotle or Da Vinci, every single one of us will read, watch, and listen to more *recordings* of people than we will ever have conversations with.

- What is written or recorded becomes *slightly* more credible, its standalone existence implies authority. To consume the media at all is to sympathize with it, if only a tiny amount. After all, as you read my words right now, you do so with an inner voice of your own making. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvne89gyq5d50yz0abhfkhq0))

- Ideology is the memetic child of mass media. Durable, non-human mediums allow for a kind of self-perpetuating machine. Superficially it looks like religion short-circuited: remove ritual, add steroids. In an ideology, thoughts are compiled, named, propagated, and slowly take on a life of their own. New information enters the ideology machine, it is massaged by the current rule-set, and an opinion appears out the other end. Original authors exert themselves on ideologies, but once they are large enough the ideologies obtain their own gravity, like celestial bodies, and we as individuals become satellites. If we get too close, we are caught in the orbit. If we get much too close, we crash. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvne9w7vnvgrhry3b5hwjzn9))

- Steeped in mass media, and therefore ideology, we now largely abandon the practice of contemplative thinking that carried us for millennia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvneb3d4qzeywsx08zsgn8pp))

- When a foreign thought arrives, the modern instinct is not to gather more from the foreigner, but to pass it through the machine and have an instant reply ready. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnebtsrpwr55qt8dw0k92hm))

- Or if it does not fit into our preferred machines, to discard the thought immediately as dangerous — perhaps at the same time labeling it with an opposing ideology, just in case. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnebwyj45p51wx1e8dt90d1))

    - Note: this is the failure of modern-day critical thinking - no one can do it!

- Ideology is strongest in politics, where it precipitates a dumbing-down of political thought until it can fit into the machine. Even with exceptionally vague descriptions, everyone would know what I’m talking about if I said “red tribe thinking” or “blue tribe thinking” in the United States. Something as vague as “what about this new gun law”, almost no matter the contents of the law, can be fed into the machines of people you are barely acquainted with, and you will mostly know their answers.

    - Note: why i don't like political parties
1
- I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnetx4xs7dkb06n0f3tat47))

- When people are prompted, *“describe yourself”*, shouldn’t we be a little alarmed when they routinely describe something else? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvneheqe29cgkrky47wgpqe6))
1
- Rather than dwelling in their own thoughts, *being* a human being, living and experiencing things and gaining wisdom, people restrain all of their wisdom faculties with these chastity belts of ideology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnehxf0gbfgnpjfdfn3e0wf))
1
- I wish for no one’s life to be easily summarized by the contortions of such machines, but many seem to welcome the labels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnek5vgpjpeezk6h117a6pz))

- If thinking is to return to us, it may be through a reordering of priorities. Living out knowledge, through the act of doing, perfecting craft, and creating with others, cannot be counterfeited like thought can. To have a devotion, or even a productive hobby, will always be more virtuous than heaving great sums of your life energy into a political maw.

- To lay a single cobblestone path is to have more virtue than attending a hundred protests, or sharing a thousand petty articles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnentd4a11gt4myy0jxm6n0))

- But Twitter offers you the chance to ignore people who only *comment* on things, and befriend those who are doing, living and flourishing publicly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnerh3r42tf8xna8174y38s))
