T - When I Sit Down to Write...

1
- When I sit down to write, I overcome procrastination by writing a terrible first draft as quickly as I can.
  Because almost all the work happens during rewriting anyway.
  The greatest friction is in putting ideas down in the first place. 
  So, I use a technique: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1459980316454490116))
1
- When an idea requires more thought than I want to put in, I write <to fill out> and glide past it.
  Your first draft is like speedrunning. The goal is to just generate and connect ideas. Remove the friction. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1459980317498904578))

- Before I write, I choose an objective for my post:
  1. Open peopleâ€™s eyes.
  2. Articulate something everyone is afraid to say.
  3. Identify key trends on a topic. 
  4. Contribute original insights.
  5. Distill an overwhelming topic.
  6. Share a solution to a tough problem.
  And so on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1459980318484492291))

- The objective gives me a north star to know when I'm done. What does a job well done look like?
  Then I pair my objective with a motivation to ensure I see the post to completion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1459980319579258885))

- Example motivations:
  1. Does writing this article get something off your chest?
  2. Does it help reason through an unsolved problem you have?
  3. Does it persuade others to do something you believe is important?
  And so on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1459980320602673157))

- I use draft 1 to find my novel ideas, which may be: 
  â€¢ Counter-intuitive
  â€¢ Counter-narrative
  â€¢ Shock and awe
  â€¢ Elegant synthesis
  Then I use draft 2 for making those novel ideas stickâ€”via: 
  â€¢ Stories
  â€¢ Analogies
  â€¢ Examples ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1459980321651261440))
