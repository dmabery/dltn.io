A - “How to Guarantee a Life of Misery”

- Demosthenes and Cicero as role models and anticipated trying to earn a compliment like Cicero gave when asked which was his favourite among the orations of Demosthenes. Cicero replied: ‘The longest one.”
  However, fortunately for this audience, I also thought of Samuel Johnson’s famous comment when he addressed Milton’s poem, Paradise Lost, and correctly said: “No one ever wished it longer.” And ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj7sdb7jeyp8behgca9je376))

- While susceptibility varies, addiction can happen to any of us, through a subtle process where the bonds of degradation are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken. And ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj7sfg9p37c1rqw8b9gzw2w9))

    - Note: How did you become addicted? Two ways: gradually, then suddenly.

- If you wish to retain the contribution of envy to misery, I recommend that you never read any of the biographies of that good Christian, Samuel Johnson, because his life demonstrates in an enticing way the possibility and advantage of transcending envy.

    - Note: If you want to keep feeling unhappy because of envy, then don't read about the life of a good person named Samuel Johnson. His life shows how you can overcome feeling envious of others and be happy.

- Disraeli compromise, designed for people who find it impossible to quit resentment cold turkey. Disraeli, as he rose to become one of the greatest Prime Ministers, learned to give up vengeance as a motivation for action, but he did retain some outlet for resentment by putting the names of people who wronged him on pieces of paper in a drawer. Then, from time to time, he reviewed these names and took pleasure in noting the way the world had taken his enemies down without his assistance.

- If you like being distrusted and excluded from the best human contribution and company, this prescription is for you. Master this one habit and you can always play the role of the hare in the fable, except that instead of being outrun by one fine turtle you will be outrun by hordes and hordes of mediocre turtles and even by some mediocre turtles on crutches.

    - Note: No matter how good you are, if you’re unreliable, people will beat you. Those in positions of power don’t choose people to follow behind them who are unreliable.
      If you’re wondering why people who are “worse” performers than you are are getting ahead of you, it’s probably because you are unreliable or can’t be trusted.

- I cannot here pass by a reference to a life described as “wonderful so far,” without reinforcing the “so far” aspects of the human condition by repeating the remark of Croesus, once the richest king in the world. Later, in ignominious captivity, as he prepared to be burned alive, he said: “Well now do I remember the words of the historian Solon: “No man’s life should be accounted a happy one until it is over.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj7ss5g7d3hsxqj6qq5xwr4x))

- There once was a man who assiduously mastered the work of his best predecessors, despite a poor start and very tough time in analytic geometry. Eventually his own original work attracted wide attention and he said of that work:
  “If I have seen a little farther than other men it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants.”
  The bones of that man lie buried now, in Westminster Abbey, under an unusual inscription:
  “Here lie the remains of all that was mortal in Sir Isaac Newton.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj7svdr8k3jyv5qs8jwr44b1))

- What Carson did was to approach the study of how to create X by turning the question backward, that is, by studying how to create non-X. The great algebraist, Jacobi, had exactly the same approach as Carson and was known for his constant repetition of one phrase: “Invert, always invert.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj7sxhy5j9vgzrgpbmcc1nax))

- Darwin’s result was due in large measure to his working method, which violated all my rules for misery and particularly emphasized a backward twist in that he always gave priority attention to evidence tending to disconfirm whatever cherished and hard-won theory he already had. In contrast, most people early achieve and later intensify a tendency to process new and disconfirming information so that any original conclusion remains intact. They become people of whom Philip Wylie observed: ” You couldn’t squeeze a dime between what they already know and what they will never learn.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj7sza2hhkhed0tb0vxmngnz))
