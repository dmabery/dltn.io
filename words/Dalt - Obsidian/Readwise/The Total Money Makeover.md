- Savings without a mission is garbage. Your money needs to work for you, not lie around ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNBE8P6&location=514))

- The story goes that if you drop a frog into boiling water, he will sense the pain and immediately jump out. However, if you put a frog in room-temperature water, he will swim around happily, and as you gradually turn the water up to boiling, the frog will not sense the change. The frog is lured to his death by gradual change. We can lose our health, our fitness, and our wealth gradually, one day at a time.

- My contention is that debt brings on enough risk to offset any advantage that could be gained through leverage of debt. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNBE8P6&location=689))

- Beverly Sills had it right when she said, “There is no shortcut to anyplace worth going.” ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNBE8P6&location=698))

- They all lived on less than they made and spent only when they had cash. No payments. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNBE8P6&location=719))

- have dealt with hundreds of strained and destroyed families in which well-meaning people loaned money to “help.” Parents loan the twenty-five-year-old newly married couple the down-payment money for the first home. It all seems so noble and nice until the daughter-in-law catches the disapproving glances at the mention of the couple’s upcoming vacation. She knows the meaning of the glances, that she should check with these well-meaning, noble parents-in-law before she buys toilet paper until the loan is repaid. A lifetime of resentment can be born right there. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNBE8P6&location=747))

- If you invested $495 per month from age twenty-five to age sixty-five, a normal working lifetime, in the average mutual fund averaging 12 percent (the eighty-year stock market average), you would have $5,881,799.14 at age sixty-five.

- If you put $495 per month in a cookie jar for just ten months, you have nearly $5,000 for a cash car. I am not suggesting you drive a $5,000 car your whole life, but that is how you start without debt. Then you can save the same amount again and trade up to a $10,000 car ten months later and up to a $15,000 car ten months after that. In just thirty months, or two and a half years, you can drive a paid-for $15,000 car, never having made a payment, and never have to make payments again.

- It is really hard to sell books and DVDs that teach the necessity of lots of hard work, living on less than you make, getting out of debt, and living on a plan, ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNBE8P6&location=1236))

- Find something to do and do that with vigor until it is complete; then and only then do you move to the next step. ([Location 1787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNBE8P6&location=1787))
