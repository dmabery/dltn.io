- Crossfield argued that knowing how to work with Inconel X alone was worth the entire cost of the X-15 program. Writing in 1960, Cross predicted that “all future space projects will benefit directly or indirectly from our work with Inconel X." (This speculation proved correct, and Inconel X would indeed be used in [several components](https://www.superiortube.com/news/latestnews/2019/may/a-superior-role-in-putting-man-on-the-moon) on the Apollo program.)

    - Note: Sometimes, the work you do on the way to accomplishing your goals become just as important, if not more important, than the goal itself.

- When Storms first arrived, the missile “was aerodynamically unstable, and couldn’t hit the target." Storms suggested adding weight to the nose to make it less tail-heavy (a trick he picked up from his model-building days). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj6va9mmn04bfttz5n2pv4m3))

    - Note: Where you learn, or how you learn, doesn’t matter. It’s what you learn.

- Next, Storms began to assemble his team, raiding the rest of North American for the best talent he could find. “His concept was simplicity itself: surround yourself with brilliant people from every conceivable discipline, get them all facing the same direction, then build a fire under their ass.” He cajoled people with the possibility of going to the moon, and the opportunity to finally work on something other than weapons designed to kill people. Storms didn’t take no for an answer: when an engineer said he couldn’t join because he needed 9 months to finish his PhD thesis, Storms assigned an entire engineering team to assist on the calculations, and the thesis was finished the following week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj6vbpexw3m4y0526z1abqtm))

    - Note: Most obstacles aren’t that serious. Often, you just need the right resources.
