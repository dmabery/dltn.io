T - Girard Believes That Rel...

1
- Girard believes that religions are based off of deceit and violence - drunken human communities projecting divine qualities on regular humans. 
  Why then does Girard believe that Christianity is true? 
  A ðŸ§µ on Girard's defense of Christianity.

- Context:
  Girard believes that religions come from, what he termed, "the scapegoat mechanism" which had 4 movements. 
  1. Chaos: Societies break down, people are at each other's throats 
  (e.g. Weimar Republic) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324346126274561))
1
- 2. Scapegoating: societies converge on innocent victims, attribute to them all the blame, murder this scapegoat in a brutal killing, and achieve peace through violent catharsis. 
  (e.g. Nazi's blaming national decline on the Jews) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324348886126592))
1
- 3. Deification: The peace which descended from this cathartic act would be so restorative that it would be treated by pre-modern people as miraculous. 
  They reason that the victim must have been a powerful divinity.
  (e.g. the exiled Oedipus being sought after) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324351604076544))
1
- 4. Institutionalization: myths and institutions stemmed out of this founding murder and became the cultural bedrock of human societies.
  (e.g. the practice of the Pharmakos stemming from the story of Oedipus) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324354300796928))
1
- Girard's explanation of religion is a popular one taken on by many contemporary atheists:
  Religion is nothing but the result of false psychological projections. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324356997840897))
1
- It is a deluded story told from the perspective of the persecuting crowd which first affirm the victims' guilt and then their divinity but both are false! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324359900319744))
1
- This anthropological conclusion presents a grave challenge to Girard's religious views (he was a devote catholic):
  Why is Christianity true? 
  At first glance, Christianity seems to perfectly conform to the scapegoat mechanism: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324362697924608))
1
- 1. Chaos: Civil unrest in Jerusalem
  2. Scapegoating: The innocent Christ is sentenced to death to please the crowd
  3. Deification: Christ becomes divinized
  4. Institutionalization: The Bible and the Catholic Church institutionalize Christianity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324365449469952))
1
- Girardâ€™s answer is that the Christian story is indeed going to have the same structure as other religions, because Christ is going to be scapegoated.
  But there is one crucial difference: Christianity will be the first religion told from the perspective of the victim. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324368125198336))
1
- Other religions always side with the crowd, the murderers - it always believes in the guilt of the victims. 
  e.g. Sophocles' telling of Oedipus affirms the judgement of Thebes that Oedipus is responsible for the plague because of patricide and incest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324370629201921))
1
- Or, take the founding murder of the Roman Republic where Romulus kills Remus to establish Rome. 
  The canonical telling paints this killing, however regrettable, as justified by Remusâ€™ hubris. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324373250838528))
1
- The Crucifixion tells the opposite story:
  â€¢ Even Christ's sentencer Pilate believes in his innocence
  â€¢ the mob is shown to be arbitrary, the true source of evil, with its charges nothing but psychological projections
  The resounding message is: the victim is innocent! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324376073641990))
1
- Christianity exposes and begins to tear down the scapegoat mechanism. 
  We will always be looking at the world through a Christian lens: siding with the victim, suspicious of the crowd, aware of unjust persecution.
  Gradually, we lose the ability to participate in scapegoating. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324378707501056))
1
- Christianity for Girard, is not just another religion but a religion to end all religions by exposing their deceitful and violent origin. 
  Surprisingly, Girard concludes that Christianity is an anti-religious force in history. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324381387837440))

- The right metaphor to think about Christianity and religion, then, is the relationship between a vaccine and the original disease.
  The efficacy of a vaccine to neutralize the disease lies in its proximity and not its radical difference. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324384181141506))
1
- Structurally the covid vaccine is very similar to the original disease, just with a few tweaks, and this similarity is what makes it an effective covid vaccine and not, say, a polio vaccine. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324388119592961))
1
- Christianity, then, is a religion vaccine. 
  It tells the same type of story as other religions but with a key distinction (siding with the victim) that begins to inoculate humanity from religion altogether. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnathanBi/status/1534324390715805697))
