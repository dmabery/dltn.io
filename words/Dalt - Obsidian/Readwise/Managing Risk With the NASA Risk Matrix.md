A - Managing Risk With the NASA Risk Matrix

1
- NASA is known to have a process for everything. They use a standardised test to measure creativity, have detailed checklists for each project, and have developed what they call the Risk Matrix to identify and manage risk.
1
- In their own words, the NASA Risk Matrix is “a graphical representation of the likelihood and consequence scores of a risk.”
1
- Given that [CONDITION], there is a possibility of [DEPARTURE] adversely impacting [ASSET], thereby leading to [CONSEQUENCE].
  Condition. The current key fact-based situation that is causing you concern, uneasiness, doubt, or anxiety.
  Departure. The undesired potential change from the original plan, which is made more likely as a result of the condition you identified.
  Asset. The project affected by the risk you identified.
  Consequence. The potential negative impact the risk can have on the asset.

- In addition to the risk statement, it is also helpful to include the key circumstances around the risk, the contributing factors, and related information such as what, where, when, how, and why. NASA calls all this additional information the context statement. “The context statement should include only facts, not assumptions. Ensure that no new risks are introduced here,” they explain.
1
- There are two main factors impacting any level of risk: how likely the potential departure is to happen (the likelihood) and negative the impact of the departure from the original plan would be (the consequence).
1
- For the likelihood score, you estimate how certain you are the risk will materialise.
  Not likely (under 20% probability of happening)
  Not very likely (between 20% and 40% probability)
  Likely (between 40% and 60%)
  Highly likely (between 60% and 80%)
  Near certainty (over 80% probabilit
