- In a *Paris Review* interview, Caro said, “In all the hours of working on ‘The Power Broker,’ Bob never said one nice thing to me—never a single complimentary word, either about the book as a whole or about a single portion of the book. That was also true of my second book, ‘[The Path to Power](https://www.amazon.com/Path-Power-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0679729453?ots=1&slotNum=1&imprToken=c4c45e53-ba77-7b1c-337&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),’ the first volume of the Johnson biography. But then he got soft. When we finished the last page of the last book we worked on, ‘[Means of Ascent](https://www.amazon.com/Means-Ascent-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/067973371X?ots=1&slotNum=2&imprToken=c4c45e53-ba77-7b1c-337&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),’ he held up the manuscript for a moment and said, slowly, as if he didn’t want to say it, ‘Not bad.’ ” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2y1n3wvhf37pr82qps2wpdh))

- Morrison met Gottlieb when she was an editor at Random House and, in her off-hours, crafting her earliest novels. “Writing my first two books, ‘[The Bluest Eye](https://www.amazon.com/Bluest-Eye-Vintage-International/dp/0307278441?ots=1&slotNum=3&imprToken=c4c45e53-ba77-7b1c-337&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50)’ and ‘[Sula](https://www.amazon.com/Sula-Toni-Morrison/dp/1400033438?ots=1&slotNum=4&imprToken=c4c45e53-ba77-7b1c-337&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),’ I had the anxiety of a new writer who needs to make sure every sentence is exactly the right one,” she once said. “Sometimes that produces a kind of precious, jeweled quality—a tightness, which I particularly wanted in ‘Sula.’ Then after I finished ‘Sula’ and was working on the third book, ‘[Song of Solomon](https://www.amazon.com/Song-Solomon-Toni-Morrison/dp/140003342X?ots=1&slotNum=5&imprToken=c4c45e53-ba77-7b1c-337&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),’ Bob said to me, ‘You can loosen, open up.’ It was as if he had said, ‘Be reckless in your imagination.’ ” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2yanp8k5dznkg3yjey71mxc))

- Some of Gottlieb’s editorial interventions became public. In 1961, Joseph Heller was coming out with a darkly comic war novel that he had titled “Catch-18.” Unfortunately, Leon Uris, the best-selling author of “Exodus,” was about to publish a novel called “Mila 18.” Gottlieb had a late-night revelation and called Heller, recommending that the title be changed to “[Catch-22](https://www.amazon.com/Catch-22-50th-Anniversary-Joseph-Heller/dp/1451626657?ots=1&slotNum=6&imprToken=c4c45e53-ba77-7b1c-337&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),” which, he declared, was somehow “funnier.” The book turned out to be a modern classic and an immense best-seller, and Heller told the story of his title change to anyone who would listen.

- “From the start, words were more real to me than real life, and certainly more interesting,” he wrote in his memoir, “[Avid Reader](https://www.amazon.com/Avid-Reader-Life-Robert-Gottlieb/dp/0374279926?ots=1&slotNum=7&imprToken=c4c45e53-ba77-7b1c-337&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2yapsbf49bpzq5ah32dqz4j))
