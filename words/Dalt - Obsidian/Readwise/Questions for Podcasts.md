- Most podcasts are boring because the interviewer is asking questions they already know the answer to, faking the role of an ignorant audience member. They're much better off asking questions they **don't** know the answer to, but **genuinely want** to know the answers to. One such genuine question, of shared interest, can often support many hours (or even a lifetime) of back and forth; but if they have no such questions, they have the wrong guest.
