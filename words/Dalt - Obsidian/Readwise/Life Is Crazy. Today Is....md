T - Life Is Crazy. Today Is...

1
- Life is crazy. Today is a good day to stop and reflect
  10 simple questions that CHANGED my life 
  (startup life, personal life)
  Here they are:
2
    - Note: Save
1
- Q: Can you really control that?
  Smart people know what they can and cannot control
  If you're living in the past, you're nostalgic
  If you're living in the future, you're anxious
  If you're living in the present, you're at peace
1
- Q: Did you start today with a victory?
  Starting every day with a victory sets you up to win
  I don't care what it is:
  - Make your bed
  - Make a wonderful coffee
  - Hug your wife or children
  No such thing as a small win. It's a win!
  You'll win more, if you start winning early
1
- Q: What are you optimizing for?
  #MFSA
  1. Money
  2. Freedom
  3. Stability
  4. Ability
  The world rewards those who are focused
  Perfectly prioritize

- Are you being optimistic?
  Guaranteed: more luck when you're optimistic
1
- Q: Are you reacting or responding?
  Remember:
  1. Reacting is emotional
  2. Responding is rational
  My most terrible mistakes are when I act emotionally. True in both my startup and personal life
  Act rational (especially on the internet)
1
- Q: Can you disagree politely?
  90% of the time: how you say it matter more than what you say
  The art of the disagreement is underrated
  Disagreement breeds productive conversations
  No disagreement, no growth
1
- Q: Are you thinking in decades or years?
  10 year resolutions are the new “new year’s resolution”
1
- Q: Are you earning trust?
  Don't focus on building success, focus on earning trust
  Trust is the rarest commodity on earth
  If you can earn trust, you can build anything
1
- Q: Do you understand the rules?
  Every game has rules. Startup game, crypto game or school game
  Success is 40% talent and 60% understanding how to beat the game.
  Key: don’t hate the player, know the rules
1
- Q: Why don't you get straight to the point?
  People are busy
  When you want something from someone, just say it
  Beating around the bush is a sin
1
- Q: Why do you take things so personally?
  - "When you’re 20 you care what everyone thinks
  - When you’re 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks
  - When you’re 60 you realize no one was thinking about you in the first place." - Reddit
1
- Q: Are you seeking the truth or do you want to just validate your beliefs?
  Seeking the truth is courageous 
  Validating your beliefs is easy https://t.co/EcVVPS5dVN
1
- Q: Are you learning fast or are you learning well?
  Good learning is slow
  And it's your ticket to a new job, raising capital, product market fit or startup success
  Good learning sticks around longer
  Point: learn slow to learn well
1
- Q: Are you building something authentic?
  The internet rewards uniqueness
  Be weird ⭐️
