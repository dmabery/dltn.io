A - Re-Noted: Virginia Woolf's Handmade Notebooks

1
- For Virginia Woolf, one of history’s greatest literary minds, to read was to converse, to hunt, to emulate, to savor. Reading was transcendent. It was a love affair.
  She confessed,
  > *Sometimes I think heaven must be one continuous unexhausted reading.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9r5p33j3d9txx8jehs1bk41))

- “The great season of reading,” Woolf suggests, “is the season between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9r5pqrm9bwab3eq8f2vqw7m))

- Just as she made her notebooks, Woolf made her own edition of Aeschylus’s play, *Agamemnon*. She took scissors to a 19th-century edition of the Greek text, pasted the pages into a notebook, and surrounded the cuttings with an English translation and notes. Woolf explains the process:
  > *I am making a complete edition, text, translation & notes of my own – mostly copied from Verrall, but carefully gone into by me* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9r5t5ngnv3p21f1fdfq22hz))

    - Note: this would be a fun project to do with a latin poem or text...what would be a good one to do?

- To begin reading with a pen in my hand, discovering, pouncing, thinking of theories, when the ground is new, remains one of my great excitements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9r5vhve242zvp009y39bptt))

- Woolf would create her own index to whatever books she was reading by marking important page numbers and a summary of information to be found there. Often these summaries included quotations or Woolf’s own reflections. She describes this method of reading as though she were on a hunt:
  > *That’s the real point of my little brown book…that it makes me read —with a pen—following the scent.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9r5w9ds40k668xp28g8485w))
