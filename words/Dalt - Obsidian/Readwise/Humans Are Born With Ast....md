T - Humans Are Born With Ast...

1
- Humans are born with astonishing curiosity.
  But somewhere along the way, we are told to stop asking questions.
  THREAD: Using the Socratic Method to reclaim your curiosity, stimulate critical thinking, and establish first principles: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796866874880004))
1
- The human mind is naturally wired for critical thinking.
  Children are born with an innate curiosity - a desire to understand the world and all of its complexities.
  They constantly ask “Why?”
  But they aren’t doing it to be annoying (contrary to what many parents might think!). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796867978022915))
1
- Children ask questions in order to develop a deeper understanding their existence and surroundings.
  They ask questions in an effort to dive deeper, think critically, and establish first principles.
  And it works!
  Children are the original first principles thinkers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796870159020037))
1
- Unfortunately, as we get older, we are typically told to stop asking questions.
  Responses like “Because I said so” or “Because that’s how we’ve always done it” pile up.
  Our critical thinking muscles atrophy.
  We begin to rely on base assumptions that we have been told are true. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796871476060160))
1
- This can be fine. It’s quick and easy to do so.
  But it can also lead to unimaginative, linear solutions to problems that closely resemble what has been done before.
  So how do we fight back and rebuild our critical thinking muscles?
  Enter our powerful tool: the Socratic Method. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796872398704641))
1
- The Socratic Method is a process of asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and expose and vet underlying assumptions and logic.
  It is both cooperative and argumentative.
  Its aim is to create an environment of productive discomfort for its participants. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796873191444487))
1
- The Socratic Method is named after the Greek philosopher, Socrates, who developed it as an alternative method of debate and teaching.
  Socrates disagreed with the style of the “sophists” of the era - teachers who used rhetoric and gravitas to entertain and persuade students.

1
- Believing that sophists were promoting a self-centered style, he began promoting the Socratic Method as an alternative.
  The basic structure involved progressive questioning to expose flawed logic, eliminate hypotheses, and sharpen thinking.
  Let’s cover how it works in practice: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796881663942661))
1
- The Socratic Method is dynamic, but typically follows a general structure:
  Step 1: Start with open-ended questions.
  Step 2: Propose ideas based on these questions.
  Step 3: Probe these ideas with progressive questioning.
  Step 4: Repeat 2/3 until the best ideas are developed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796882448277511))
1
- Imagine your team has encountered a challenge that requires an imaginative solution.
  Start at the surface.
  What is the problem you are trying to solve?
  We often waste time and energy trying to solve the "wrong" problem.
  Identify the “right” problem before you try to solve it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796883333320706))
1
- Now for the fun: Dive deeper.
  Sketch out your current thinking on the problem, including the origins of that thinking.
  Open the floor for targeted questioning:
  Why do you think this? Is the thinking too vague? What is it based upon?
  Challenge each other (collaboratively!). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796884239339526))
1
- Challenge the assumptions underlying the original thinking.
  Why do you believe this to be true? How do you know it’s true? How would you know if you were wrong?
  Identify the source of beliefs on a problem.
  Be ruthless in evaluating their integrity and validity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796885086486532))
1
- Evaluate the evidence used to support the thinking.
  What concrete evidence do I have? How credible is it? What “hidden evidence” may exist?
  Understand of the consequences of being wrong.
  Can this be quickly fixed? How costly is this mistake?
  Always understand the stakes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796885929529346))
1
- Evaluate the potential alternatives.
  What alternative beliefs or viewpoints might exist? Why might they be superior?
  Why do others believe them to be true? What do they know that I don’t?
  Evaluate them on their merits and ask these same fundamental questions about them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796887154368519))
1
- After zooming in, zoom out.
  What was my original thinking? Was it correct? If not, where did I err?
  What conclusions can I draw from the process about systemic errors in my thinking?
  So we have seen how it works. Let’s cover some practical applications of the Socratic Method: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796888131559426))
1
- The Socratic Method in Investing
  The best investors have long been proponents of the Socratic Method.
  Every proposal is questioned and dissected from a variety of angles (at least in theory).
  It makes it difficult for an investment based on flimsy assumptions to pass through. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796888970399747))
1
- Note: This doesn’t mean every investment made ends up being a successful one!
  It simply ensures that investments are grounded in clear, evidence-backed assumptions (even if changing circumstances later disprove those assumptions).
  Surface-level thinking is quickly rooted out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796889922527238))

- The Socratic Method in Startups
  Elon Musk is an advocate of the method:
  “One particular thing that I learned at Queen’s was how to work collaboratively with smart people and make use of the Socratic method to achieve commonality of purpose.”
  Tesla & SpaceX both rely on it. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7s8vUrXsAQlhRf.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796894980837377))
1
- The Socratic Method can be powerful unlock when teams are working on complex problems that require imaginative solutions.
  Question base assumptions, ask “why?” incessantly, and expose flawed logic to uncover better hypotheses.
  SpaceX is one such example - there are many more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796896465723398))
1
- The Socratic Method in Education
  The Socratic Method is a mainstay of legal and medical education curriculums, but has been forgotten in most other fields.
  Most programs favor lecturing.
  Few encourage targeted, rigorous questioning or environments of productive discomfort. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1421796897291911174))
1
- This is one reason why our critical thinking muscles wither as we get older.
  We aren’t training them!
  Note: Change is coming. Programs like @synthesischool are specifically designed to create productive discomfort and encourage questioning in children.

1
- The Socratic Method is simple, yet as these varied examples have shown, it is dynamic, powerful, and useful across a range of situations.
