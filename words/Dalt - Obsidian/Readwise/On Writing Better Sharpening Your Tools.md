A - On Writing Better: Sharpening Your Tools

1
- → If you are to find your way as a writer, you must use words that are fresh; you can’t use other people’s leftover language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw55phremyb8dsxqkckhv64k))
1
- If you ever find yourself typing that something “…will have an effect on…” or “…had an impact on…,” it isn’t your writing that’s passive. **It’s you!** How dare you pretend that you are providing any information by telling your reader that something will have an “impact” or an “effect” on something else? Nearly everything in the universe has an effect or an impact on other things! Delete that passive crud and tell us what will happen: It “…will devastate…” or “…will rejuvenate…” or “…will eradicate…” or “…will repair…” **without** resorting to the pallid abstractions of “impact” or “effect” or “result.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw55qm9rz7vz3znv9xgkm8je))
1
- Once you develop the habit of recognizing “there is” as passive language that serves no purpose, you will be able to look at “There was somebody at the door” and automatically edit it to “Somebody was at the door.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw55rt8q67dckxn82rv3gvdf))

- That brings us to **Zweig’s Law of Passive Language:**
  > Writers resort to passive wording when they are actively trying to hide something.
  …and its **First Corollary**:
  > The thing they are trying to hide is usually their ignorance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw55tn40mjyts5z4p46yy4bv))
1
- And that brings us to the **Second Corollary of the Law of Passive Language**…
  > Another thing they are trying to hide is the emptiness or flimsiness of an idea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw55vbvfz12qj0wvqg3daft2))

- In each case, the distancing verb is extraneous. Turn the noun structure back into an active verb and then kill the distancing verb:
  “**The formation of** the new government **occurred** after the rebels…” (passive)
  “The rebels **formed** the new government after they…” (active)
  “**The debate between** Democrats and Republicans **concerns** whether…” (passive)
  “Democrats and Republicans **are debating** whether…” (active)
  “**The misunderstanding among** the customers **involved** the price of…” (passive)
  “The customers **misunderstood** the price of…” (active) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw55yh8mfywbath150mq7ths))

- In a similar failure, some verbs feel active but fade into passivity in the wrong hands. Look what happens to the energetic verb “to stem” in this sentence:
  > One reason why the struggling retail chain survived for years stemmed from the fact that consumers couldn’t find cheaper prices elsewhere.
  What is this junk about “one reason” that “stemmed from the fact that”? The reason didn’t stem from anything!
  To make the sentence active, do this:
  > The struggling retail chain survived for years because consumers couldn’t find cheaper prices elsewhere. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw55zsfws9qw1qwmv4exg4w2))

- Writing better is all about paying attention to the smallest details. If you don’t treat each word with exquisite care, you can’t improve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw561z4gj0tat8g05w6x406c))

- →Most people handle words as if they were pennies: light, cheap, dispensable. Instead, I want you to handle them as if they were manhole covers or 45-pound weights in the gym. Think before you pick them up. Look before you put them down. Make sure you choose the right one and put it in the right place. Words shouldn’t be cheap to you and interchangeable. They should be dear to you and fit-for-purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw562d6dsz6gbcnqjn80m9z4))
1
- But trying to expunge every instance of passive language from every sentence will make your writing far better than it is — no matter how good it already may be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw564nh7wvvcwmhzvmzbxn0d))
1
- I regard clichés as just another form of passive language. Every time you write “going south” or “going through the roof” or “taking a nosedive” or “the only game in town” or “I wouldn’t touch it with a ten-foot pole” or “a veritable Who’s Who of [whatever]” or “off on a wild goose chase” or “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” or “paying the piper” or “shooting the lights out” or “shoot first, ask questions later,” these words are happening to you; you aren’t making them happen.

- When you have to garble a cliché to make it seem fresh, you know your language has lost any semblance of life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw566c6y6mwa6nn9mhfbdzy0))
1
- If you’re trying to say “it will go down in history,” what makes you so sure? Show, don’t tell: How bad is the damage? Give us numbers or imagery, not a lame reference to “proportions.”) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw568mp1kgj9zgvmd0dvmhr7))
