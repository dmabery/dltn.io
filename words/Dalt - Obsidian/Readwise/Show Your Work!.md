What’s inside your scrapbook? What do you pin to the corkboard above your desk? What do you stick on your refrigerator? Who’s done work that you admire? Who do you steal ideas from? Do you have any heroes? Who do you follow online? Who are the practitioners you look up to in your field? ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=328))

- The first act is where you’ve been—what you want, how you came to want it, and what you’ve done so far to get it.
