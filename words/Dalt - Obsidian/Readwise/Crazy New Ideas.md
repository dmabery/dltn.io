A - Crazy New Ideas

1
- Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they're proposing it anyway. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414590020/16479733))
1
- The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions, because there's a real mystery here. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414590020/16479760))
1
- But even if they're mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an expert falls into is one you have to worry about too. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414590020/16479764))

- Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble. It's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414590020/16479769))

- People build whole careers on some ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they feel threatened. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414590020/16479779))
1
- The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically dismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414590020/16479780))

- If you're nice, as well as wise, you won't merely resist attacking such people, but encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonely business. Only those who've tried it know how lonely. These people need your help. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something in the process. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414590020/16479851))
