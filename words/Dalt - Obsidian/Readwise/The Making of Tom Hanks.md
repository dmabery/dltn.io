  How Tom Hanks Became Tom Hanks
  The actor—and now novelist—reflects on how he got here, and the other lives he might have lived instead.

  There is a particular circumstance deep in Tom Hanks’s past that he thinks may explain something significant about the person he is now. One that suggests how, before all of this—before everything he would achieve and come to represent in the world, before he had even begun to work out what talents he might have and how he might best use them—he was already well on the way to becoming who he would be.

  As a child, several times a year, Hanks would take a long journey on a Greyhound bus, heading to and from the small Northern California town of Red Bluff. He was often alone, and he always sat by the window. In Red Bluff, Hanks would stay with his mother, Janet; after his parents’ marriage ruptured when he was 5, he never lived with her, but on holidays he’d visit. And so, from when he was 8 until he was 17, four or so hours each way, he’d take this ride.
  ![black-and-white school portrait photo of smiling boy with short dark hair](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/xeEXXOBcxpu4bWRLCEgy2zEgDPc=/300x339/media/img/posts/2023/05/0623_Heath_Hanks2/original.jpg)
  Hanks, around age 10 (Alamy)
  Those journeys, they released something within him. Sometimes he read a little, maybe a comic, maybe a book, but mostly he’d stare out into the passing world. He’d watch the broken sine wave of the telephone lines, looping on and on and on for miles, then veering away, then rejoining the bus’s path. He’d see a barn, wonder what was on the other side. A house would flash by; he’d imagine who lived in it. Some figures standing outside: What were they doing? A plane up in the clear sky: All those people, where were they going and what were they thinking? The couple in that car as the Greyhound passed, the guy by himself in the truck, that station wagon loaded up with kids in the back, that locomotive on the train tracks …
  In his mind, all of these questions and thoughts would mix with what was already sloshing around—the movies he’d seen, the stuff he liked to read about space exploration. Sometimes it would coalesce into a narrative. He’d see himself flying a jet, being an explorer, winning the day, gaining revenge, getting into a fistfight. Sometimes it would just flow and flow, as the day’s light faded and his destination edged nearer. A boy by a window, imagining what was and what could be.
  Half a century later, Tom Hanks meets me in the lobby of Claridge’s hotel in London, clutching the rectangular stick of a negative COVID test in one hand. When he and his wife, Rita Wilson, [contracted COVID](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-coronavirus/607888/) in the anxious early days of the pandemic, it made Hanks, in his words, “the celebrity canary in the coal mine.” Back then, his infection seemed [disproportionately unsettling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/12/coronavirus-tom-hanks/). If he describes being a little taken aback by the attention it drew—“When your name appears in a chyron on CNN as breaking news: ‘Oh, I guess we’re a bigger part of the zeitgeist than we anticipated’ ”—well, perhaps he is not as invested as the wider culture is in the idea of Tom Hanks as some kind of cherished symbol, benignly treasured in a way few public figures are. “An avatar,” as *The New York Times* [put it last year](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/13/magazine/tom-hanks-interview.html), “of American goodness.”
  Looking back, we might imagine that this idea of Hanks built up gradually, emerging through the years as he accrued status and dignity. Not really. Here’s a representative sample of ways he was already described in the 1980s: “a funny and vulnerable Everyman,” “an affable soul without a visible speck of vanity in his makeup,” “more like the nice neighbor next door than a movie star,” “regular guy as star,” “the everyguy,” “an unshakable nice-guy image.” By 1988, he was [delivering](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0694515/) a *Saturday Night Live* monologue that morphed into an extended skit satirizing the cliché of how relentlessly nice he is. How he is seen now is pretty much how he has been seen for a very long time.
  Hanks, who is 66, appears lithe and sprightly, almost as though he has too much energy for such a slip of a body. He is in town to shoot a movie, Robert Zemeckis’s adaptation of Richard McGuire’s *Here*, a graphic novel in which every frame takes place in a single living room in a house. This will be the fifth collaboration between Zemeckis and Hanks, an irregular series that began with *Forrest Gump* and *Cast Away*. But the occasion for our talk is something more immediate: the publication of Hanks’s first novel.
  He’s keen to talk about that, and plenty else besides. Hanks is at his most animated when the words coming out of his mouth are something along the lines of “I just learned recently why there’s so many covered bridges in America. You know why there’s so many covered bridges in America?” And he’s off. A while after we sit down, he declares, “I’m not on any schedule,” and more than four hours of conversation pass before he suggests that perhaps he should spend some time with his f ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1q9189h0zwqtymrnhbbe4e1))

- when he was free to concentrate on this project, was a productivity trick he’d read about in *The New York Times* called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/magazine/pomodoro-technique.html), based on a discovery made by an Italian student: If he set a timer for 25 minutes and focused totally on work for that period, then broke for five minutes, then repeated it all, he would get far more work done ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1qak26epynghj9n5dnfd6je))

- superhero movie titled *Knightshade: The Lathe of Firefall* ; Hanks realized that to tell his novel’s story, he had to know exactly what happened in that movie, and he could see but one good way to do that. So he paused writing his novel for a couple of months in order to write a real script for the fake movie whose filming his novel would document.

- “They had to do it on a Zoom, and they had to show me their credentials, and they just informed me: My name was on that list. And that’s all they were doing. They said, ‘You should know this.’ And I said, ‘Wow.’ ”
  And that was all?
  “That’s it. I said, ‘Really? Hey, wow.’ I thought, *I’ll let everybody I love know.* But again, what are you going to let control your life, for crying out loud?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1qb1kdr8nr49acqsv629ct9))

- Hanks offers a corollary from wartime history, something he read in the William Manchester book [*Goodbye, Darkness*](https://tertulia.com/book/goodbye-darkness-a-memoir-of-the-pacific-war-william-manchester/9780316501118?affiliate_id=atl-347)—how General MacArthur, aware of huge pockets of Japanese forces and arms on various Pacific islands, deliberately decided not to attack them. “And so these Japanese soldiers essentially sat out the war doing nothing.” MacArthur just left them there. “And I thought, *That’s friggin’ brilliant. You’re really smart in the battles you don’t fight.*” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1qb27mb0w4qtwkb17nkjjzq))

- At one point in our conversation, pressed into another way to explain himself, Hanks begins a thought with “In my writing—” then stops himself.
  “I don’t like to say ‘In my writing.’ ”
  Why not?
  “Because it makes it sound as though I’m”—he assumes a pompous voice—“ ‘Well, in my writing …’ ”
  Which makes you sound like what?
  “Like people who do it in order to say, ‘Well, you know, in my writing …’ I just do writing. I write because I’ve got too many fucking stories in my head. And it’s fun.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1qb5hn0epc9ygatcdtb2t4d))

- “I think that is one of the deep reasons why I wanted to do the book in the first place,” he says. “If I was going to say ‘What’s the theme of this?,’ it’s that doing this is not as easy as it seems. That doing this is so difficult that it breaks people wide open. You can look at all sorts of people that had the ability, had the credit, and then took the deep-throw shot, it didn’t work, and they were gone … It’s hard, man. It’s hard … And the joy and the fun have to come in spite of the fact that it’s difficult.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1qbbb2xhwxzkyvzn3m88qpt))
