A - How James Clear Is Writing His Next Book

1
- Positioning is starting where the reader is, and bringing them to where you want them to go ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqgaq01b0rgdv393fza01nkn))

- This is the reverse of how most people write. Most people start with something they want to say or a point they want to make, and try to move *from* that point *to* the reader.
  I think it’s actually better to work the other way—to ask what people *already* desire. Then move backwards from there to that point you wanted to make. If you do that, you don’t have to fight an uphill battle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqgarz8t39endbgxfxc304kn))

- I don’t need to convince you that habits play an important role in life—just by virtue of growing up in society you know that having good habits is favorable, and having bad habits is unfavorable.
  On the other hand, ‘deliberate practice’ is a term that takes at least thirty seconds to unpack—and you don’t get thirty seconds. If somebody is just browsing and comes across your book, chances are they have no idea who you are, and you’re not going to be there in person to explain ‘deliberate practice’. You’ve already lost them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqgat8cvvnaa1rb22n3s7y53))

- You don’t want to have to convince people that they should care about your idea. It’s much better to be convincing them that you have the best book or product on an idea they already care about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqgatm4jkyf7fsf83emzvset))

- Well, they have a really good tagline: ‘the hidden side of everything’. It compresses that forty-five minutes into one little sentence. And they compress that even further: the very word ‘Freakonomics’ has become shorthand for ‘the hidden side of everything’.
  ‘Freakonomics’ is a made-up word. They can own it, and it can occupy an independent position in the listener’s or reader’s mind that doesn’t compete with anything else. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqgawdraejn0pnjs2dak3460))

    - Note: What word or phrase could I create to capture the essence of “the backstory” of something.
1
- I just removed his words, and left the framework, ‘*Blank* is the *blank* of *blank*.’ I played with a bunch of variants until I eventually came up with ‘Writing is the antidote to confusion.’ I tweeted that out and it went over well.

    - Note: Create a doc for sentence templates like this.

- But after all of that, I still need to wake up every day, be a good person, and work on the same things that I was working on before. And if I want to continue to be a writer, I need to keep writing—that identity starts to expire if you don’t use it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqgb96c708xqf4qs3104pahy))

    - Note: …”that identity starts to expire if you don’t use it.”
      “Good habits start to expire if you don’t use them. So do bad ones.”
      I’ve realized: all habits have an expiration date. This is good news and bad news.
      The good news: bad habits expire if you don’t use them.
      The bad news: good habits expire if you don’t use them.

- But I don’t want to be the adult version of the kid who peaked in high school, or the person who had a hit, and is still talking about it ten years later. Now is the time to move on to the next thing and try to do a good job with it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqgbckermjqp90777cwe116p))
