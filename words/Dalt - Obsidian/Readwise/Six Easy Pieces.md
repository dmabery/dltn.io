B - Six Easy Pieces

1
- First figure out why you want the students to learn the subject and what you want them to know, and the method will result more or less by common sense. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=253))

- “The power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous.” (Gibbon) ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=368))

- Following these preliminary remarks, the first three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us develop a “feel” for the subject.

- Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected. The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific “truth.” ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=399))

- theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and guess at new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are experimental physicists who experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=407))

- Mass is found to increase with velocity, but appreciable increases require velocities near that of light. A true law is: if an object moves with a speed of less than one hundred miles a second the mass is constant to within one part in a million. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=413))

- Matter is made of atoms ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=429))

- atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=432))

- Now 10-8 cm is called an angstrom (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple.
