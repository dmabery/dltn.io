- So, knowing what I know about Crichton, do I wish I could have lived a life more like his?

- I can’t tell you for certain that having a crappy career and a happy marriage is better than having a successful career and a crappy marriage, because I have never had a successful career or a crappy marriage. But tonight, my wife and I will sit together at our dining-room table as we have done almost every evening for the past 43 years and share tales of how our days went as we eat dinner together. After that, we will probably sit and watch TV together for an hour or two, frequently talking over the dialogue as is our wont. If you are thinking that my life sounds a bit sad in comparison with the lives of Madonna or Michael Crichton or Lady Di or Prince, I encourage you to think again.
