T - OK, Tried Out a New Unit...

1
- OK, tried out a new unit in my intro to philosophy class, and it is my new favorite unit: "Are Grades Bullshit?" 
  I have never seen intro students more intensely engaged, more edge-of-their-seat, and more mind-blown.

- The "covering frame" for this chunk of the course is unearthing the moral content of colloquial language. It's kind of a cheap trick: the students think it's going to be fluffy and chill. Hey, we're going to do the philosophy of assholes and bullshit! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168403444252673))
1
- The week before we do a bit of @OnAssholes "Assholes: A Theory" and @nickriggle's definition of "awesome" and "sucking", which is actually a neat backdoor way to introduce Kant. And the students are all warmed up for the main event. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168405025361920))
1
- "Are Grades Bullshit?" week opens with, of course, Frankfurt's classic, "On Bullshit". We get Frankfurt's account of bullshit speech: the liar needs to keep track of the truth to manipulate you, the bullshitter doesn't care about the truth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168406434574341))
1
- When I teach "On Bullshit", I always point out that there's a larger sense of "bullshit" lurking beneath the surface of the paper, of which "bullshit speech" is just one type. Call it "cosmic bullshit". Frankfurt hints at in when he point out military parades are bullshit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168407818690560))
1
- Military parades aren't speech. Hence, we need a larger notion of "cosmic bullshit": an activity which has drifted from its true purpose. (The military is supposed to be about defense, parades are about spectacle and politics. Boy, do my military students love this part.)

1
- So, day 2: I have them read this blog post about ungrading, and we talk about why grading is part of the university, and the relationship of grading to the true goals of education.

1
- What they get here is some basic theory about bureaucracy, standardization, and why simple quantitive grades are really important from the POV of admin. It's hard to aggregate qualitative reports, but easy to average letter grades. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168412247949314))
1
- This is basically a download of Scott's Seeing like a State, and Bowker and Star on standardization. A GPA is incredibly useful for large-scale management of students. (And useful for doing large-scale data collection about the general effectiveness of certain outcomes.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168413728514048))
1
- The larger point is to get them to reflect on the gap between the bureaucratic function of letter grades, and the real value of an education - whatever they think that is. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168415259385861))
1
- What is incredibly useful here, to have in the background, is this amazing article on the history of standardized grading in America, which @doctaj got me onto. I don't assign it, but it's the heart of the lesson plan.

- It's about how early American education was based on the German system of ranking students to inspire competition. But then how activists figured out *in early 1800's* that this screwed up education, by over-narrowing student focus. And how back then, we shifted away. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168418140946437))
1
- WE HAD FIGURED OUT THE PROBLEM WITH NARROWED FOCUS THROUGH NARROWED GRADES and shifted to richer, more qualitative evaluations, *in the 1800's*. 
  What drove us back? The need for the standardization of educational certificates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168419692838912))
1
- The current GPA regime arises from the need to say that, say, a HS diploma means you'll have skills x, y, and z. I didn't need to point it out: the students themselves pointed out that this serves the interest of employers, and not necessarily their own educational interests.

1
- OK, after all that, day 3, I just walk into class and say, "OK, so are grades bullshit?" and give the floor to them. 
  What followed was literally the best day of discussion I've had in an intro class. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168422578495488))
1
- The first 20 minutes were, like, more like therapy than philosophy. Students were telling stories about how they used to love school and now they hated it, about having their curiosity burned out, about all the things they used to care about but have stopped. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168424038141953))
1
- I have never had students more gripped, more engaged in an intro class, thinking more intensely. And I think it created a degree of... skepticism about received values and beliefs more than anything else I've done. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168425468383232))
1
- One student said they felt like Neo in the Matrix, seeing for the first time the true nature of the world in which they'd grown up in, unthinking. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168426953105410))
1
- At the I end the day by having them talk with me about whether or not I should ungrade this very intro class next time I teach it. I let them into my own tortures. I myself often ungrade upper-div classes, but every attempt to ungrade gen-ed and intro classes has failed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168428379254784))
1
- Basically, given that all the other classes grade in a normal manner, whenever I try to ungrade intro classes, students just stop coming to classes. Students will literally tell me, "This is my favorite class but because I know I can get an easy A, so I can't waste time on it." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168429759094785))
1
- Anyway, that was 6 weeks ago, and students have been coming back to me obsessed with the topic all term. A bunch of them chose to write about it for their final papers. I'm doing this unit forever. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1521168431109664769))
