1
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a $54 billion behemoth. 
  It's bigger than Marriott, Netflix, and Twitter...combined.
  Yet 99% of us don't actually understand the business.

    - Note: Save
1
- AWS is electricity for the internet. 
  It is the largest provider of on-demand, cloud computing services in the world. 
  With 33% of a $150 billion global cloud market, AWS makes our digital lives possible.

- So now, you hopefully buy why AWS important. 
  But how did it start? 
  Let's hop in our tweet thread time machine.... https://t.co/KDrWo8Skvz ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859380378865668))
1
- It's 2003. 
  You're Jeff Bezos & your business is growing like a weed. 
  1999: $1.64 billion (revenue)
  2000: $2.76 billion
  2001: $3.12 billion 
  2002: $3.93 billion 
  2003: $5.26 billion 
  But you have a serious problem... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859381704368128))
1
- IT is a bottleneck to Amazon's growth. 
  Employees are spending 70% of their time on tech infrastructure. 
  - Building servers
  - Provisioning databases 
  - Scaling databases
  Everything but focusing on Amazon's customers.

1
- Save them time & you can:
  1) Help 3rd party retailers build their own web stores
  2) Focus on faster customer innovation internally
  3) Handle peak traffic during the holidays

1
- You need someone to solve this problem. 
  Someone you can trust. 
  Enter Andy Jassy. 
  Yes, the same Andy Jassy who was named as Amazon's newest CEO on July 5, 2021. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E58JoVEWEA8xr8t.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859400834592776))
1
- Jassy joined Amazon in 1997, right around the company's IPO. 
  His first job was in Marketing, working on the launch of Amazon Music. 
  His second job was as Jeff Bezos's Chief of Staff. 
  And his third job was to solve this tech headache plaguing the company. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859402751348743))
1
- By late 2003, Jassy shared a vision for an "Internet Operating System." 
  The idea: take this tech mess & simplify it into a shared platform with 3 building blocks...
  - Storage
  - Computing
  - Databases
  Employees could now spend 70% of time serving customers vs. racking servers.

1
- Ultimately, Amazon got really good at managing tech infrastructure.
  Good enough, where Jassy said something along the lines of...
  "Hey we're pretty good at this IT thing. It was a pain in the ass for us & it's a pain in the ass for others. Why don't we make this a product?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859409651027968))
1
- So in 2006, AWS was born. 
  It was the first pay-as-you-go IT infrastructure, shepherding a new era of cloud computing. 
  Here's the OG announcement ðŸ‘‡

1
- AWS was an instant unlock for customers. 
  1) Fixed costs became variable costs
  2) Economies of scale lowered costs
  3) On-demand created flexibility & speed
  4) You didn't have to maintain servers
  5) Global reach & performance

- Take Netflixâ€”a big AWS customerâ€”for example. 
  If you go to https://t.co/safVVDRpI5, youâ€™re seeing that homepage because of AWS. 
  Your computer is actually connecting to an AWS server via the internet. 
  And that server hosts https://t.co/safVVDRpI5 on behalf of Netflix.

1
- It's simple, but so powerful. 
  First, Netflix is significantly more cost-efficient because of AWS. 
  Without AWS...
  Netflix would purchase thousands of physical servers, pay for real estate to house them, and hire people to maintain them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859434313420804))
1
- Second, Netflix has far more flexibility. 
  Letâ€™s say Netflix projects 300mm customers in 2022.
  It would have to buy enough servers to satisfy 300mm customers. 
  Let's say 2022 actuals are 250mm. 
  Netflix lit millions of $ on fire by predicting too much demand. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859435148201991))
1
- That is why AWS exists. 
  Rather than buy compute power or storage, you rent space from AWS based on your server needs today. 
  Now that you understand AWS, there are two final lessons we can learn from this business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859435949215748))
1
- Lesson 1: Dogfooding is a great strategy for launching new products.
  AWS was founded out of Amazonâ€™s frustration with its own tech situation. 
  Everyone was spinning up resources (like servers) for each project versus scaling, sharing, and reusing servers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859436897132548))
1
- Andy Jassy & co built out a set of shared services that engineers could access easily as needed. 
  https://t.co/Dqrc2Fvb9B was customer #1 for this service, a service that would end up becoming the operating system of the internet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859437832556548))
1
- Lesson 2: AWS is a textbook beneficiary of Scale Economies. 
  The business has massive fixed costs from owning and maintaining millions of servers. 
  As it attracts more customers, the economics get better & the moat gets bigger. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859438872731657))
1
- Step 1: pay a shit ton for servers
  Step 2: as biz grows, spread massive costs across more customers
  Step 3: as per customer costs decrease, lower price of AWS for customers 
  Step 4: as price of AWS decreases, competitors put in shitty spot
  Step 5: world domination ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1413859440000999424))
