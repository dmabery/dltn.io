A - The Internet Wants to Be Fragmented

1
- You know…fifteen years ago, the internet was an escape from the real world. Now the real world is an escape from the internet.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmepazsykf33f8d35tnkd594))

- The early 2010s on Twitter were defined by fights over toxicity and harassment versus early-internet ideals of free speech. But after 2016 those fights no longer mattered, because everyone on the platform simply adopted the same patterns of toxicity and harassment that the extremist trolls had pioneered. By 2019 you could get mobbed by angry librarians, or Saturday Night Live fans, or history professors. The only defense against an angry mob was to get your own angry mob. Twitter felt like a prison, and in prison you need a gang to survive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr3dnzhhv2r5bwjy4j88pkr))

- *Community moderation works* . This was the overwhelming lesson of the early internet. It works because it mirrors the social interaction of real life, where social groups exclude people who don’t fit in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr3ehht6hz1hjryt3szfd1d))

- That experiment failed. Humanity does not want to be a global hive mind. We are not rational Bayesian updaters who will eventually reach agreement; when we receive the same information, [it tends to polarize us](https://substack.com/redirect/0ca590be-45fd-43a4-adaf-b8074097f065?j=eyJ1IjoiM2p3OGIifQ.tSxlJ89HG6Nvs7yBDVx8CGHOKhzXI6ddU18drzeFUJ8) rather than unite us. Getting screamed at and insulted by people who disagree with you doesn’t take you out of your filter bubble — it makes you *retreat back inside your bubble* and reject the ideas of whoever is screaming at you.

- No one ever changed their mind from being dunked on; instead they all just doubled down and dunked harder. The hatred and toxicity of Twitter at times felt like the dying screams of human individuality, being crushed to death by the hive mind’s constant demands for us to agree with more people than we ever evolved to agree with.

- What these rising apps and platforms all share is *fragmentation* . Whether it’s intentional self-sorting into like-minded or community-moderated groups, or the natural fragmentation that comes from a bunch of different people watching their own algorithmically curated video feeds, these apps all have a way of separating people based on who they want to talk to and what they want to be exposed to.

- This is how we restore the old internet — not in its original form, but in its glorious, fragmented essence. People call Twitter an indispensable public space because it’s the “town square”, but in the real world there isn’t just one town square, because there isn’t just one town. There are many.

- Let the internet once more be an escape — a place where you can find your people and be happy. Let us learn to speak a thousand different languages once again. Let the Tower of Babel fall. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmr3vhas4a8ydanxdjqqj4hd))
