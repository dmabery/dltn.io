A - Efficiency Is the Enemy

1
- All that time Gloria spends doing nothing isn’t wasted time. It’s slack: excess capacity allowing for responsiveness and flexibility. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410621924/16326609))

Both of them would be less effective as a result. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410621924/16326631))
