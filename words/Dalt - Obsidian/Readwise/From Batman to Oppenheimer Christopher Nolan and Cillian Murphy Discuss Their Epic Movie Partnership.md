A - From Batman to Oppenheimer: Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy Discuss Their Epic Movie Partnership

1
- Everybody was so excited by watching you perform that when I then said to them, "Okay, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?" there was no dissent. All the previous Batman villains had been played by huge movie stars: Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, that kind of thing. That was a big leap for them and it really was purely on the basis of that test. So that's how you got to play Scarecrow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p11cykb3rcy03e4k85ex9s))

- **NOLAN** I'll talk very frankly about *Dunkirk*. I remember, Cillian, I called you up, and I said, "I really need you for this small but vital part, out on that boat, suffering from PTSD, and I'll send you a script." I remember, very clearly, you called me, and said, "Can't I play a Spitfire pilot instead?" [*Laughs*] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p14w323ztebqt0t86f9kc0))

- experiences. I think the best thing that happens from re-collaboration is that you get this level of trust. I think that's allowed us to continue to make interesting work. To me, that's the most important thing. If you trust the director, you can really go out on a limb, and be vulnerable, and expose yourself emotionally.

    - Note: You need to trust, both parties need to trust, to create great work. You can’t create something amazing with dissent or fear that someone won’t do their part.

- **NOLAN** Trust is creatively freeing, because you feel like you can try things, and there are no wrong answers, nobody's going to chastise you, or laugh at you. It's like, okay, let's just try a few different things, *and* then trust on the fundamental level of, okay, we're going to take you on a boat, and we're going to sit you on top of an overturned hull, and on a cue, you're going to jump off into the sea. [*Laughs*] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p17peasrn98gdgszbtyzp6))

- **NOLAN** No one knew what I was up to, no one knew what I was doing. To be able to pick up the phone, and call you, and be like, "This is the one where you carry the movie and really get to show what you can do," it's honestly one of my favorite moments in the movie business, when I had that conversation with you.

- **MURPHY** Yes, massively. That's the only script that I've ever read that's been in the first person. It took me a minute, maybe a bit more than a minute, to figure that out. But then it became clear that you wanted it to be completely subjective, that everything was to be seen through the character's eyes as it were, and, again, yeah, that added massively to the terror.

- **NOLAN** I was thinking that it even applied to the extras. We were in the real Los Alamos and we had a lot of real scientists as extras. We needed the crowd of extras to give reactions, and improvise, and we were getting sort of impromptu, very educated speeches. It was really fun to listen to. You've been on sets where you've got a lot of extras around and they're more or less thinking about lunch. These guys were thinking about the geopolitical implications of nuclear arms and knew a lot about it. It actually was a great reminder every day of: We have to be really on our game, we have to be faithful to the history here, and really know what we're up to.

- Not at all," says Nolan, with a laugh. "If I could cast Cillian in every film I ever do, and just lean on him for the rest of my career, I'd be a happy man." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p1cv9crp1sgkec4n287rxt))
