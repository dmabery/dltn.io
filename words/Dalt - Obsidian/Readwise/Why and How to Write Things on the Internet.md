A - Why and How to Write Things on the Internet

1
- So: lower your bar for what’s worth writing about! My personal standard is **anything that I’ve said more than once in a conversation**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhqravxx68y4va5e213vpzc))

- The easiest way to get demotivated about writing is to compare your first post to the polished output of your favorite writers, conclude you’ll never get that good, and give up. This is a mistake. Almost nobody’s first post is amazing (see e.g. [mine](https://www.benkuhn.net/www-prefix/)); instead, most writers learn incrementally about what works and what doesn’t as they publish more. The two commandments above are about going through that feedback cycle as fast as possible. All the specific advice below is given with the intention of optimizing for this.

- n fact, my suggestion is to make all your writing-related choices to optimize for this. If something seems like a good idea in principle, but would make it harder for you to write consistently or slower to get feedback, don’t do it.

- Next, start paying attention to topic ideas. These can come from lots of different places. Here are some that have worked for me (with examples from both my blog and others’):
  • Something you said in a conversation with a friend that surprised them ([In defense of blub studies](https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/), [You don’t need to work on hard problems](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/))
  I’m not sure if this is true of other writers, but for me, this one is my most reliable source of good post ideas!
  • Document a project you did recently—what went well, what went poorly ([Your room can be as bright as the outdoors](https://www.benkuhn.net/lux/), [Comparing the Same Project in Rust, Haskell, C++, Python, Scala and OCaml](https://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/))
  • Explain how to do something you do (this post, [Why and how to start a startup serving emerging markets](https://www.benkuhn.net/emco/), [My weekly review habit](https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/), [How to make video calls almost as good as face-to-face](https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/))
  • Explain how something works ([Why squared error?](https://www.benkuhn.net/squared/), [What is a major chord?](https://www.jefftk.com/p/what-is-a-major-chord))
  • Review a book ([*Why Nations Fail* and the long-termist view of global poverty](https://www.benkuhn.net/wnf/), [Book review: Legal Systems Very Different From Ours](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/))
  • Curate a set of links about a topic ([My favorite essays of life advice](https://www.benkuhn.net/weeklyessays/), [Gwern’s Most Important Writing (in essays, tweets, book reviews, and other forms)](https://guzey.com/favorite/gwern/))
  • A rant ([Wireless is a trap](https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/), [Matthew Walker’s “Why We Sleep” Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/))
  • Something internet commenters/public intellectuals frequently say that seems wrong ([Don’t claw back employee options](https://www.benkuhn.net/clawback/), [The Problems with Deliberate Practice](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/)) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhqzen1z2ms63s3pg64gp1q))

- Don’t let yourself get bogged down from publishing by the feeling of “I should really respond to all those comments.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhr26sfyq3qpnda89b9jj4b))

- Because of the above, the main value of draft readers is often *getting their overall reaction* rather than those detailed improvement suggestions (though those can be helpful), ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhr2mavx8xs24raagqp3seg))
