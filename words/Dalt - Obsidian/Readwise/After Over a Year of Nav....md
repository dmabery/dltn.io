T - After Over a Year of Nav...

1
- After over a year of navigating a global pandemic, a return to in-person collaboration is in sight. Teams everywhere are planning how they'll work together when offices re-open.
  Asana will have an office-centric synchronized hybrid environment.

- We've always co-created in distributed ways across our global offices, had remote roles, and occasionally WFHd. The Asana product is essential to making this work.
  Still, there is no substitute for the connection and team flow we experience when we're in the same space together. https://t.co/3qYwjjcjEX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1384556027492794378))

- That means Asanas and our 150 new open roles will be primarily colocated in our 11 global offices, with flexible hours so that people can optimize when and how they work best.
  And now, our No Meeting Wednesday policy will evolve to include the option of Work from Home Wednesday. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1384556029149519878))

- This flexibility allows Asanas to take advantage of things like foregone commute time or the ability to take breaks to spend time with family, which have been some bright spots in our learnings from the pandemic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1384556030181318660))

- The synchronization ensures that:
  - when we're in the office, *whole* teams benefit from in-person collaboration (rather than typically being in a "mixed mode")
  - when we're home, individuals benefit from minimal distractions (bc meetings will be intentionally rare on those days) https://t.co/4ualp21KRX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1384556033922662403))

- We’re particularly excited about our new HQ in San Francisco—a 12-floor LEED Gold-certified building, featuring communal spaces, a beautiful new commercial kitchen/dining area, dedicated wellness zones, and a rooftop garden that provides outdoor gathering space. 
  It's awesome. https://t.co/kq0xwVlBRi ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1384556039173935105))

- We’ll take a phased approach, gradually ramping back into a full return to our offices. Of course, we can’t imagine planning this w/o Asana as our foundation. Aligning on who/what/when allows us to stay flexible while keeping the right people informed, all with minimal effort. https://t.co/7WolZ4V473 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1384556042520907778))

- We approach our company culture like a product, applying the same design principles that we use to build Asana. In the spirit of our value, reject false tradeoffs, we aim to achieve an exceptional office-centric culture while adopting the best elements of hybrid models.
