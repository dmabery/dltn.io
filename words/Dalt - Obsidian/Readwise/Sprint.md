B - Sprint

1
- My best work happened when I had a big challenge and not quite enough time. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=79))
1
- ‘How do you make coffee at home . . . ?’ ” Braden repeated. Everyone jotted notes. James had started the sprint by explaining his vision: that the online store should match the hospitality of the cafés. It felt as if we were onto something. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=335))

- James and the Blue Bottle team built confidence with their sprint. They ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=355))
1
- Here are three challenging situations where sprints can help: ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=362))
1
- High Stakes ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=363))
1
- Not Enough Time ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=366))
1
- Just Plain Stuck ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=369))
1
- the sprint forces your team to focus on the most pressing questions. Second, the sprint allows you to learn from just the surface of a finished product. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=388))
1
- When our new ideas fail, it’s usually because we were overconfident about how well customers would understand and how much they would care. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=394))
1
- Get that surface right, and you can work backward to figure out the underlying systems or technology. Focusing on the surface allows you to move fast and answer big questions before you commit to execution, which is why any challenge, no matter how large, can benefit from a sprint. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=395))
1
- To build the perfect sprint team, first you’re going to need a Danny Ocean: someone with authority to make decisions. That person is the Decider, a role so important we went ahead and capitalized it. The ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=406))
1
- We’ve found the ideal size for a sprint to be seven people or fewer. With eight people, or nine, or more, the sprint moves more slowly, and you’ll have to work harder to keep everyone focused and productive. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=449))
1
- Sprints are most successful with a mix of people: the core people who work on execution along with a few extra experts with specialized knowledge. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=454))
1
- They had deep expertise and they were excited about the challenge. Those are people you want in your sprint. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=460))
1
- Choosing whom to include isn’t always easy, so we’ve created a cheat sheet. You don’t have to include each and every role listed here. And ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=462))
1
- Before every sprint, we ask: Who might cause trouble if he or she isn’t included? We ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=483))
1
- There are stacks of studies about the cost of interruption. Researchers at George Mason University found that people wrote shorter, lower-quality essays when interrupted in the middle of their work. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, reported that it takes on average twenty-three minutes for distracted workers to return to their tasks. (We plan to read more of these studies, right after we answer this text message.) ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=525))
1
- Monday’s structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll start at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll ask the experts at your company to share what they know. Finally, you’ll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=637))
1
- Instead, NASA got organized and sorted their priorities before they started on solutions. That’s smart. And that’s the same way your team will start your sprint. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=659))
1
- you and your team will lay out the basics: your long-term goal and the difficult questions that must be answered. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=663))
1
- Starting at the end is like being handed the keys to a time machine. If you could jump ahead to the end of your sprint, what questions would be answered? If you went six months or a year further into the future, what would have improved about your business as a result of this project? ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=663))
1
- “Why are we doing this project? Where do we want to be six months, a year, or even five years from now?” ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=668))
1
- Your goal should reflect your team’s principles and aspirations. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=678))
1
- Once you’ve settled on a long-term goal, write it at the top of the whiteboard. It’ll stay there throughout the sprint as a beacon to keep everyone moving in the same direction. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=679))
1
- What caused it to fail? How did your goal go wrong? ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=683))
1
- What questions do we want to answer in this sprint? • To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true? • Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might have caused that? ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=693))
1
- You won’t have to capture every detail and nuance. Instead, you’ll just include the major steps required for customers to move from beginning to completion, in this case from cancer diagnosis to trial enrollment. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=775))
1
- Deciding who to talk to is a bit of an art. For your own team, you probably have a hunch about the right people already. We think it’s useful to have at least one expert who can talk about each of these topics: ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=842))
1
- Start by talking to the Decider. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=844))
1
- “What will make this project a success?” “What’s our unique advantage or opportunity?” “What’s the biggest ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=845))
1
- We frequently talk with two, three, or four “how things work” experts to help us understand how everything fits together. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=853))
1
- Your final task on Monday is to choose a target for your sprint. Who is the most important customer, and what’s the critical moment of that customer’s experience? ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=999))
1
- Once you’ve clustered your team’s How Might We notes, the decision about where to focus your sprint will likely be easy. It’s the place on your map where you have the biggest opportunity to do something great (and also, perhaps, the greatest risk of failure). ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1036))
1
- As you go, ask the team, “Does this look right?” or “How should I capture that?” And when the conversation starts to stall out, you can nudge it to conclusion by saying, “Is there a good way we can capture this thinking and move on?” ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1070))
1
- On Tuesday, you’ll come up with solutions. The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. Then, in the afternoon, each person will sketch, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. Later in the week, the best of these sketches will form the plan for your prototype and test. We hope you had a good night’s sleep and a balanced breakfast, because Tuesday is an important day. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1096))

- remix and improve—but never blindly copy. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1117))
1
- Lightning Demos. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1120))
1
- Your team will take turns giving three-minute tours of their favorite solutions: from other products, from different domains, and from within your own company. This exercise is about finding raw materials, ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1120))
1
- Time and time again, the ideas that spark the best solutions come from similar problems in different environments. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1122))
1
- Because abstract ideas lack concrete detail, it’s easy for them to be undervalued (like your idea) or overvalued (like the boss’s idea). ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1225))
1
- But working alone isn’t easy. The individual has to not only solve the problem, but also invent a strategy for solving the problem. If you’ve ever sat down to work on a big project and wound up reading the news instead, you know how hard this work can be. ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1233))
1
- instead to find the first small action needed to make progress (like “Collect tax paperwork”) and go from there. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1248))
1
- This first step is super-easy. You and your team will walk around the room, look at the whiteboards, and take notes. These notes are a “greatest hits” from the past twenty-four hours of the sprint. ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1258))
1
- In this step, each person will jot down rough ideas, filling a sheet of paper with doodles, sample headlines, diagrams, stick figures doing stuff—anything that gives form to his or her thoughts. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1269))
1
- Crazy 8s is a fast-paced exercise. Each person takes his or her strongest ideas and rapidly sketches eight variations in eight minutes. Crazy 8s forces you to push past your first reasonable solutions and make them better, or at least consider alternatives. ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1278))
1
- The exercise works best when you sketch several variations of the same idea. Take a favorite piece from your ideas sheet and ask yourself, “What would be another good way to do this?” Keep going until you can’t think of any more variations, then look back at your ideas sheet, choose a new idea, and start riffing on it instead. ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1285))
1
- We’ve used sprints with startups in all kinds of industries. One surprising constant: the importance of writing. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1314))
1
- In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1391))
1
- Normally, if we want the benefit of everyone’s perspective, we’re forced to endure these slogs. But not in a sprint. We’ve structured Wednesday to do one thing at a time—and do it well. We’ll evaluate solutions all at once, critique all at once, and then make a decision all at once. Kind of like this: ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1405))
1
- Explaining ideas has all kinds of downsides. If someone makes a compelling case for his or her idea or is a bit more charismatic, your opinion will be skewed. If you associate the idea with its creator (“Jamie always has great ideas”), your opinion will be skewed. Even just by knowing what the idea is about, your opinion will be skewed. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1471))
1
- 1. Don’t talk. 2. Look at a solution sketch. 3. Put dot stickers beside the parts you like (if any). 4. Put two or three dots on the most exciting ideas. 5. If you have a concern or question, write it on a sticky note and place it below the sketch. 6. Move on to the next sketch, and repeat. ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=1478))
