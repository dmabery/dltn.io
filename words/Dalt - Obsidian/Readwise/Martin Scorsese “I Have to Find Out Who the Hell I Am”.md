A - Martin Scorsese: “I Have to Find Out Who the Hell I Am”

1
- Let go of the studio system: “I thought I was in a Hollywood group. It didn’t work.” Let go of self-delusion, which is maybe the hardest thing of all to let go of. Shape the thing you’re making into a pure expression of the thing you’re making: “Cut away, strip away the unnecessary, and strip away what people expect.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk2sjb7y8vbqae8m68bdgyx))

- As a young boy, he says, “watching films came out of a necessity from the illness of asthma. And it came out of a loneliness, which I still have.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbyhwwhrscj5xwgvydkka54d))

- All these people you’ve known and loved – “they suffered and struggled so much, and then life is over,” said Scorsese. “You get to the point of saying, ‘Well, what does it all mean?’ It doesn’t matter what it means. You have to live it. And if you choose not to live it, you choose not to live it; that’s up to you. But you are existing and you live with that existence. And so I think that has changed. And I don’t want to necessarily move the camera if I don’t want to any more. I don’t. I don’t care. I just don’t care about that any more ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbyjax1p3nejg2b6011qyj0k))

- Scorsese said. “So he makes a film called *Sleep.* In which it’s a man sleeping for five hours. One shot ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbyjcx8hm8gy454wvm6nd209))

- Scorsese talks about Father Principe a lot. This was the man who interested him in the Church, where he once thought he’d be a priest. “And one of the things he talked about was – this goes back to the [first Academy Awards](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gallery/best-style-in-oscars-history), when they were first televised, I think it was *On the Waterfront* that won, or *From Here to Eternity*, maybe.” (It was actually *The Greatest Show on Earth*; *From Here to Eternity* and *On the Waterfront* won the following years.) And on television, which Scorsese watched at home, was this giant Oscar on the stage: “It was like three storeys high.” And so everyone came to school excited the next day, except for Father Principe, who said, “Did you see what that image was on television? And we all, as kids, were looking at each other, and not knowing what he was getting at. He said, ‘That was the Golden Idol.’ That was, he didn’t say this word, but that was Moloch. And that means you’re serving a god that is success.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbyjhnd8sz86c835tw382k5b))

- He likes to borrow a complaint from Kubrick. “They said, ‘What’s the hardest thing about directing?’ He said, ‘Getting out of the car.’ Because once you get out of the car, the questions start.” Now, when Scorsese gets out of the car in the morning, he looks at his AD and says, “What *can’t* I have today?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbyjmj07skm4s97gjhrghsdw))

- “I always liked being nominated at the Academy, even though knowing – especially the fact that they didn’t nominate us for *Taxi Driver*” – the film was nominated, as were its stars, Jodie Foster and Robert De Niro, but not Scorsese or his screenwriter, Paul Schrader – “and *Raging Bull*, when I didn’t get the Oscar, I understood that that wasn’t my lot in life. But I always said this: just be quiet and make the movies. You can’t make a movie for an award. Sure, I would’ve liked it, but like, so what? I mean, I had to go on and make pictures.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc27fxdvqgv9kyzh6ddvmmsz))
