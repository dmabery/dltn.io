A - What Makes Paul Graham a Great Writer?

1
- He organizes each essay around a razor-sharp core idea.
1
- Dr. Jaworski frames it as “a pithy one-liner that serves as an organizing principle for the whole essay.”
1
- Usually, you can grasp the core idea of a Paul Graham essay by reading the title. My favorite examples are The Two Kinds of Moderate, The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius, and Write Like You Talk.
1
- He doesn’t fall in love with his ideas.
1
- if you want to have good ideas, you have to accept the reality of having bad ones.
1
- You can’t ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren’t.
1
- That’s because those 13 ideas have been curated from a wide range of options. The essay is not the product of 13 ideas; it’s the product of 1,000+ ideas, narrowed down to 13.
1
- Choosing that path to the exclusion of the others requires being a ruthless self-editor—someone who can step back & observe his own writing from a healthy distance. This process is the mark of a good thinker, and it’s also a mark of a good writer
1
- He couples concepts with concrete examples.
1
- Graham uses lots of examples because he knows concepts are tools used for thinking about the world.
1
- Paul Graham’s examples show you how to apply concepts to real life.
1
- Applying unfamiliar concepts to familiar examples makes those concepts easier to master.
1
- f something that seems like work to other people doesn’t seem like work to you, that’s something you’re well suited for.
1
- He creates rhythm by varying sentence length.
1
- Imagine you and I are taking a leisurely stroll, conversing as we go—the pace of our words matching the pace of our strides. Then something happens. There’s something I want to say, but I have trouble saying it. It’s important. We slow down. We stop. I struggle to find the words. I utter them. One. By. One. For emphasis. See? I’m being waggish, of course, but I trust you see the point: when you want to emphasize something, you need to slow the reader’s pace with shorter sentences and bolder punctuation. Conversely, when you’ve covered what’s important, you need to regain momentum using longer sentences and lighter punctuation, and might even forgo full stops entirely in favor of commas, conjunctions, semi-colons, dashes, and other devices that keep the reader moving.”
1
- He doesn’t underestimate your intelligence.
1
- He’s codified his own rules, and he follows them.
1
- Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over.
  cut out everything unnecessary.
  write in a conversational tone.
  develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours.
  imitate writers you like.
  if you can’t get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said.
  expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong.
  be confident enough to cut.
  have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag.
  don’t (always) make detailed outlines.
  mull ideas over for a few days before writing.
  carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you.
  start writing when you think of the first sentence; if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence first.
  write about stuff you like.
  don’t try to sound impressive.
  don’t hesitate to change the topic on the fly.
  use footnotes to contain digressions.
  use anaphora to knit sentences together.
  read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs you dread reading).
  try to tell the reader something new and useful.
  work in fairly big quanta of time.
  when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far.
  when you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with.
  accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don’t feel obliged to cover any of them.
  write for a reader who won’t read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on crappy car radios.
  if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately.
  ask friends which sentence you’ll regret most.
  go back and tone down harsh remarks.
  publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas.
  print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen.
  use simple, germanic words.
  learn to distinguish surprises from digressions.
  learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.
