A - How Bestselling Author Austin Kleon Writes, Part Two

1
- If I ever teach a class on imagination, I’m going to show House Hunters because imagination gets this very, “Oh, to have an imagination is this great skill and talent.” Look, imagination is something that [Dave Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hickey) said. He said, “Imagination is just thinking of a door and seeing it in your head.” Imagination is simply the ability to make images in your head.

- When you watch House Hunters, these people come into these houses, and they’re like, “Oh God, I really hate the floors.” It’s like, “Oh, I don’t like that paint color,” and they literally can’t get past the fact that this hideous paint. They simply cannot think of what life in this house could be like. Like, “We could rip up the carpet. We could put floors in. We could paint over this paint.” But there are so many people that live their lives like that, too. They literally can’t make images in their head about what could be.

- **Austin Kleon:** I have a really dumb, basic version, a definition for creativity, which is just taking what’s in front of you and everybody else and turning it into something new, that’s not around, inventing something out of the materials that we all have available to us.

- **Kelton Reid:** What do you think makes a writer truly great?
  Why Your Audience Is Your Most Valuable Asset
  **Austin Kleon:** The right readers. I think it’s true of all the arts. It’s all about who’s on the other end. You can be the best writer or the best artist in the world, and if you don’t have the right readers or the right buyers or the right viewers, what does it do? Think about [Melville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville) dying penniless, and now everybody reads Moby Dick. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2yhdrvtp3e48xvmd4tnqj39))

- There has to be readers. If you’re a writer and you’re not a reader, I know you’re not any good. There’s no possible way you’re a good writer if you’re not a good reader. That was always the big siren went off, like when you’d be in a writing workshop in college and someone says, “Oh, yeah. I really like to write, but I don’t really like to read.” You could write that person off immediately because they’re just no good. It just doesn’t work that way.

- **Austin Kleon:** The quote I live by is Flaubert. [Gustave Flaubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert). He said, “Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work.” What Flaubert is saying is that you have to be boring in a sense. If you’re having adventures all the time, you’re not going to have any time to work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2yhfxxxqdppe9jpmszjb4qe))

- I’m actually trying to write a talk solely based on that quote right now and that tension between, as a creative person, you feel like you should be out having adventures, but then you also have to sit in a room all day and make something happen — and how do you balance those two — that kind of thing.

- Like [George Saunders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Saunders) would be someone I would hang out. Not only is he a genius, certified, he’s also a mensch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2yhhmxsszgny79pqjdmy44r))

- **Austin Kleon:** I’m going to say something that everyone kind of rolls their eyes when I say it, but I think it’s really true, which is marry well. Marry well. Pick your partners in crime very carefully. That’s true of your romantic partner. It’s true of your business partners. It’s true of your friends. Surround yourself with people who are going to make you better, but also people who will put up with you and will put up with this really bizarre thing that you’re trying to do with your life.
  I’m going to steal this from [Ian Svenonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Svenonius). If you’re a lawyer or a doctor, everyone’s going to applaud your decision. They’re going to be like, “Great, you’re a lawyer.” “You’re a doctor. Awesome!” You know, “You’re a nurse.” “You’re a teacher.” Whatever. But if you tell people you’re a writer, they’re going to be like, “Well, have you written anything I’ve read or might have seen?” Or, “Do you make any money off that?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2yhks9cr1md5ty71j2xma7n))
