A - You Have to Really Love Your Idea

1
- I saw a clip of writer [Robert Greene](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpiMo5OunCS/) talking about creative work that really rang true:
  > “You have to really love your idea. It has to be something from deep within. It has to be personal. It has to excite you on a deep level. Because you’re going to have to persevere for several years. There are going to be a lot of critics, a lot of mean-spirited people are gonna say, ‘You can never do that!’
  > 
  > When you create anything, the spirit you create it with, the energy, the excitement, is translated into the product itself. So when somebody writes a book just for money, you can kind of smell it. When you read the book, it kind of reeks. We can sense that. But when the writer is excited, it excites the reader. So the love and the desire you put into your project will translate.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr8b07w30vhx4ad0hhabkzk))
