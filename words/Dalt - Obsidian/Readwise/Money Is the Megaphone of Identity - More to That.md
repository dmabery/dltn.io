A - Money Is the Megaphone of Identity - More to That

1
- As the bonds with my loved ones strengthened and took shape, this truth grew apparent and faded that fear out of my mind. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014590))
1
- What has changed isn’t money itself, but the way in which it colors the way I view the world. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014592))
1
- This is what I call The Money Spectrum, and it represents the wide variety of views we have about the almighty dollar/euro/whatever throughout our lives. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014598))

- Phase #1: Survival ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014610))
1
- A low-income household and an upper middle-class family may both rent property, but the former may worry incessantly about next month’s payment, while the latter may not. Both understand the importance of money, but have different ideas of how their survival could be impacted by the lack of it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014618))
1
- Homelessness is an ever-present window into the difficulties of the human condition, and it reminds you of what can be possible when things go wrong. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014631))
1
- A job provides this sense of security, and when you view money as a means for survival, holding this job is all that matters. It doesn’t matter how much you hate your job or how terrible the working conditions may be; as long as the number of hours you work result in a predictable deposit amount, you’ll succumb to it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014654))
1
- Toward the upper end of this phase, survival becomes more about your mindset and less about your reality. You are well past the place where you risk sleeping in the streets, but you may continue to operate under the belief that it could happen at any time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15014658))
1
- This is the first taste of money as a tool for freedom. When money is used to sustain a lifestyle rather than life itself, you have moved out of Survival and into this new territory. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15054734))
1
- The problem with freedom-as-leisure is that it is fundamentally asymmetrical. You have to work significantly more hours for each hour of leisure you may gain, which means that if you hate your job, you have to accumulate a lot of misery before you can cash it in for freedom. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15054765))
1
- Rather than using money as the ticket out of an unfulfilling career, use it as the ticket in to a fulfilling one. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15054779))
1
- The first thing that the freedom-in-work model does is that it lowers the threshold of money you need to continue your work. When work in itself is fulfilling and worthwhile, you become more content with a minimal lifestyle. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15054793))
1
- What’s so great about having money if you’re using it to live a life you’re expected to live, instead of one that makes sense for your unique abilities and perspectives? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1373135818/15054814))
