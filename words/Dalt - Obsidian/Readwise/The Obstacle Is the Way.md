B - The Obstacle Is the Way

1
- Every obstacle is unique to each of us. But the responses they elicit are the same: Fear. Frustration. Confusion. Helplessness. Depression. Anger. You ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=128))
1
- What do these figures have that we lack? What are we missing? It’s simple: a method and a framework for understanding, appreciating, and acting upon the obstacles life throws at us. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=142))
1
- “The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.” ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=194))

- “The Things which hurt,” Benjamin Franklin wrote, “instruct.” ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=212))
1
- WHAT IS PERCEPTION? It’s how we see and understand what occurs around us—and what we decide those events will mean. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=239))
1
- sangfroid: unflappable coolness under pressure. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=253))
1
- You will come across obstacles in life—fair and unfair. And you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure. You ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=284))
1
- We can stop seeing the “problems” in front of us as problems. We can learn to focus on what things really are. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=298))
1
- Discipline in perception lets you clearly see the advantage and the proper course of action in every situation—without the pestilence of panic or fear. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=306))
1
- To control emotions and keep an even keel To choose to see the good in a situation To steady our nerves To ignore what disturbs or limits others To place things in perspective To revert to the present moment To focus on what can be controlled ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=315))
1
- Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been. —MARCUS AURELIUS ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=322))
1
- “Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so,” as Shakespeare put it. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=358))
1
- As for us, we face things that are not nearly as intimidating, and then we promptly decide we’re screwed. This is how obstacles become obstacles. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=363))
1
- through our perception of events, we are complicit in the creation—as well as the destruction—of every one of our obstacles. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=365))
1
- There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=366))
1
- Grace and poise are, because these two attributes precede the opportunity to deploy any other skill. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=400))
1
- There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are high, but the path is there for those ready to take it. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=408))
1
- apatheia. It’s the kind of calm equanimity that comes with the absence of irrational or extreme emotions. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=444))
1
- As Gavin de Becker writes in The Gift of Fear, “When you worry, ask yourself, ‘What am I choosing to not see right now?’ What important things are you missing because you chose worry over introspection, alertness or wisdom?” Another way of putting it: Does getting upset provide you with more options? Sometimes it does. But in this instance? No, I suppose not. Well, then. If an emotion can’t change the condition or the situation you’re dealing with, it is likely an unhelpful emotion. Or, quite possibly, a destructive one. But it’s what I feel. Right, no one said anything about not feeling it. No one said you can’t ever cry. Forget “manliness.” If you need to take a moment, by all means, go ahead. Real strength lies in the control or, as Nassim Taleb put it, the domestication of one’s emotions, not in pretending they don’t exist. So go ahead, feel it. Just don’t lie to yourself by conflating emoting about a problem and dealing with it. Because they are as different as sleeping and waking. You can always remind yourself: I am in control, not my emotions. I see what’s really going on here. I’m not going to get excited or upset. We defeat emotions with logic, or at least that’s the idea. Logic is questions and statements. With enough of them, we get to root causes (which are always easier to deal with).

1
- Does what happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness? Nope. Then get back to work! ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=474))
1
- The phrase “This happened and it is bad” is actually two impressions. The first—“This happened”—is objective. The second—“it is bad”—is subjective. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=484))
1
- Just think, what happens when we give others advice? Their problems are crystal clear to us, the solutions obvious. Something that’s present when we deal with our own obstacles is always missing when we hear other people’s problems: the baggage. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=513))
1
- when you can break apart something, or look at it from some new angle, it loses its power over you. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=532))
1
- Where the head goes, the body follows. Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=570))
1
- Focusing exclusively on what is in our power magnifies and enhances our power. But ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=627))

- Fortune magazine (ninety days after the market crash of 1929) FedEx (oil crisis of 1973) UPS (Panic of 1907) Walt Disney Company (After eleven months of smooth operation, the twelfth was the market crash of 1929.) Hewlett-Packard (Great Depression, 1935) Charles Schwab (market crash of 1974–75) Standard Oil (Rockefeller bought out his partners in what became Standard Oil and took over in February 1865, the final year of the Civil War.)

- Or we get ourselves so worked up and intimidated because of the overthinking, that if we’d just gotten to work we’d probably be done already. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=653))
1
- For all species other than us humans, things just are what they are. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=661))

- Emerson put it best: “We cannot spend the day in explanation.” Don’t waste time on false constructs. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=663))
1
- But it’s easier when the choice to limit your scope feels like editing rather than acting. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=675))
1
- Genius is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind. There’s no other definition of it. —F. SCOTT FITZGERALD ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=679))
1
- Our perceptions determine, to an incredibly large degree, what we are and are not capable of. In many ways, they determine reality itself. When we believe in the obstacle more than in the goal, which will inevitably triumph? ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=695))
1
- To them, the idea that no one has ever done this or that is a good thing. When given an unfair task, some rightly see it as a chance to test what they’re made of—to give it all they’ve got, knowing full well how difficult it will be to win. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=722))
1
- A clearer head makes for steadier hands. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=811))
1
- Therefore, we can always (and only) greet our obstacles with energy with persistence with a coherent and deliberate process with iteration and resilience with pragmatism with strategic vision with craftiness and savvy and an eye for opportunity and pivotal moments Are ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=889))
1
- all the greats you admire started by saying, Yes, let’s go. And they usually did it in less desirable circumstances than we’ll ever suffer. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=951))
1
- proving that genius often really is just persistence in disguise. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=980))
1
- never in a hurry never worried never desperate never stopping short ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1003))
1
- Persist in your efforts. Resist giving in to distraction, discouragement, or disorder. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1006))
1
- When failure does come, ask: What went wrong here? What can be improved? What am I missing? ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1042))
1
- Great entrepreneurs are: never wedded to a position never afraid to lose a little of their investment never bitter or embarrassed never out of the game for long They slip many times, but they don’t fall. ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1050))
