1
- I've got a secret to tell you...
  Your boss is tired of being your manager.
  They want you to manage them.

- Raise your hand if this has ever happened to you:
  Boss: Ask me questions any time.
  You: Ok I have a question.
  Boss: Why can’t you try to figure things out on your own??
  Very frustrating. But there's a workaround. Here are my frameworks for managing up: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926444070817806))

- Most people incorrectly assume increased seniority implies less communication.
  Ironically the opposite is true.
  Senior employees are the BEST at communicating & managing up. They proactively communicate to show they've got it handled and prevent endless one-off questions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926451524096002))

- The secret: Let your boss think they are managing you.
  But in reality, YOU are managing THEM.
  It’s a Jedi mind trick. The more you manage your boss, the more they think you are doing great work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926475020640260))

- Three tips to manage your boss:
  Offer solutions, not problems
  Make requests, not complaints
  Keep your boss in the loop
  Remember: As much as you can’t read your boss’ mind, they can’t read yours either.
  Let’s dig into each tip: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926479294681096))
1
- #1 Offer solutions, not problems
  We tend to go straight to the issue.
  🚫 “This won’t work because of X.”
  ✅ “X will make this difficult. But if we do Y, then it has a greater chance of success.”
  This shows you’re proactive and solution-oriented. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926485489618958))

- #2 Make requests, not complaints
  You feel burnout creeping on.
  🚫 “I can’t keep doing this. I’m exhausted.”
  ✅ “A vacation in the next couple months would be great. How do these dates work?”
  This implies to your boss that you need a break but in a more positive manner. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926491319701507))

- #3 Keep your boss in the loop
  Tactical tip: Agree to an update cadence for each project you’re working on--daily or weekly depending on the project’s scope.
  This way they know you’re doing a great job AND they don’t need to micromanage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926493110710280))

- Managing up effectively has lots of benefits. Your boss:
  Believes you’re capable
  Believes you’re worth investing in
  Believes you’re worth going to bat for
  They’ll take credit for managing you well. And that’s okay… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926495690207237))
1
- It’s actually good to let your boss take this credit.
  Because they’ll feel overwhelmingly positive, warm, and grateful for you.
  Translation: Your boss will love you for managing up without knowing you are, in fact, managing them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926497699188741))

- Important note: These ideas DO NOT apply to toxic bosses--those who throw you under the bus, gaslight you, and refuse to acknowledge your contributions. Sadly many of us have had to work under leaders like this & the damage can take years to undo. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926499364384769))
1
- When your boss loves you, you have options:
  Take on more interesting projects
  Spar 1:1 and riff on interesting ideas
  Room to grow and develop skills in new areas
  In short, you get the benefit of the doubt. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926501348237314))
1
- You have more control over your relationship with your boss than you think.
  And it all starts with embracing that it’s your responsibility to manage your boss. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1451926505391591426))
