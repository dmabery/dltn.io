T - Here‚Äôs the Story of How...

1
- Here‚Äôs the story of how I (almost) lost everything building and selling my last company Islands to WeWork
  I‚Äôve never told this story publicly. Sharing it on Twitter because sharing is caring
  Here we go‚Ä¶... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918989501706242))
1
- In June 2016, I was having tea in SF and realized ‚Äúgroup chat is the new social network‚Äù
  My thinking: everything would be verticalized
  You‚Äôd have group chats around finance, around gaming, around work etc.
  People want fluid, spontaneous communities/groups, not newsfeeds ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918990323732485))
1
- I had previously sold a company. I created a short slide pitch deck
  I raised $2m from some of the world‚Äôs best investors on an idea. From first pitch to money in the bank in 45 days
  We had no product. No prototype. No users. Just a crazy idea ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918991200391174))
1
- SF is sometimes magical like that. It was a privilege
  We were off to the races ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918992043393026))
1
- We built the product. We decided to focus on colleges
  The idea: open up Islands on your campus, see group chats around you, form communities and create relationships
  It was like Slack for communities. Focused on college ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918992861335554))
1
- We beta launched at 1 school: University of Western Ontario (Canadian school)
  Why?
  - If you screw up in Canada, no one pays attention
  - If you screw up at NYU, everyone pays attention
  Tip: places like New Zealand, Canada, Australia are great places to launch your app ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918993679233026))
1
- We started scaling colleges
  Hundreds of thousands of messages were flowing through the Islands systems
  But retention sucked. Most people weren‚Äôt sticking around
  Note: if people aren‚Äôt sticking around, you‚Äôre dead in the water ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918994551648256))
1
- Mashable said we were taking over college campuses!
  Axios said we were the next Facebook!
  Marc Andreessen told me he loved our progress. He was a role model of mine. Validation! 
  Realistically: we had blown through $1.5m and we were scrambling to get to product/market fit ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918995474382851))
1
- Most of the colleges we were live at were in the South of the US
  Alabama. Mississippi. Georgia.
  I had to get out of SF. The only way to zig-zag to product/market fit is to understand your community
  I was 28. I went ‚Äúback to college‚Äù and spent 9 months of my life in Alabama ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918996967514115))
1
- I think it was Inc Magazine that called me ‚Äúwhen 21 Jump Street meets Silicon Valley‚Äù
  Damn. I had to do it. Sometimes you have to do crazy things to make your startup succeed.
  Cost of doing startup business
  Goodbye California. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918997831532551))
1
- We iterated on the product. Adding features. Removing features. Adding. Removing.
  We obsessed over onboarding, viral loops, copy. That stuff matters
  These details make or break products ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918998691373065))
1
- FINALLY! We did it
  We got retention in a place that it was higher than products like Twitter
  Community-based product design works. I‚Äôll die on that cross
  Islands started to work! Now it‚Äôs time to go raise VC to scale this baby ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380918999551246338))
1
- Picture this.
  It‚Äôs 2018. It a social media winter
  No one wanted to fund social apps. People are into AI, IoT and VR 
  The narrative was: Facebook was just going to copy you. Just give up
  Ouch. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919000390045699))
1
- Buuuut we had a product that was WORKING
  Our metrics were 2x what some top Series A firms told me they needed to see in order to lead the round in 2016
  Retention was high. Growth was good. The average user invited 2+ people
  I had to raise this Series A... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919001329590273))
1
- Despite the social winter. VCs listened to me 
  I pitched EVERYONE. Partners meetings at almost every major fund. I pitched about 100 VCs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919002193612801))
1
- Yet, no checks came in. I couldn‚Äôt get the money I needed 
  I wanted to ‚Äúgo big or go home‚Äù
  That‚Äôs why you start a social app. That‚Äôs why you move to Silicon Valley
  It was time to go home... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919003103789060))
1
- So, we decided we should sell the company
  In Dec 2018, we found a massive internet company that wanted to buy us
  We met their leadership team. They loved us and were excited about the partnership ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919003913318401))
1
- WE DID IT!
  We‚Äôre going to make internet history! Woo hoo! 
  Champagne glasses cheersing üçæü•Ç
  I‚Äôm picturing the news headlines now‚Ä¶
  Can you blame me?
  Until I get this call that would change my life a few weeks later... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919004756389892))
1
- I get a call on Christmas eve. It was one of their execs
  The deal is off. They decided they‚Äôd just build their community feature internally
  DAMN! We were banking on this 
  Our bank account was almost zero. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919005628792837))
1
- I had to regroup. Greg this is going to work out. We‚Äôll find someone else
  I had to personally fund the business until we figure this out
  Merry Christmas to me üòÖ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919006538895366))
1
- Head up, I find my way in the door of any company (tech or not) interested in community
  We started to get offers
  Meanwhile, my bank account continued to dwindle... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919007369441282))
1
- A few months later. We finally sell the company
  It‚Äôs WeWork. We‚Äôre excited about the partnership. I‚Äôm excited about the new chapter
  Here's my final investor update. Please read https://t.co/8FJiq2BmwU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919011119104005))
1
- I learned a lot from this rollercoaster
  Key takeaways coming up: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919014042517505))
1
- 1. If you‚Äôre a VC-backed business, and you‚Äôre space isn‚Äôt hot anymore, funding becomes 100x harder
  Trends come and go. So be sure to do everything in your power to NOT be dependent on venture capital
  Avoid dependency ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919014919041024))
1
- 2. The M&A process sucks
  It‚Äôs a difficult process. Takes a toll on you
  Key: optimize for multiple offers, not for price ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919015904788487))
1
- 3. Startups rewire your brain
  I‚Äôll never be the same after this experience
  Startups are as much as a business endeavor as a personal endeavor
  It was an incredible experience ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919681603756032))
1
- 4. The secret to win the game against billion dollar competition: invent and play another game
  The product features that made us stand out versus competition were the unique features
  A good exercise: what‚Äôs the roadmap for the anti-Spotify, the anti-Instagram, the anti-Amazon ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919682476163075))
1
- 5. Mental health is wealth
  I had so much support from good friends, family and had my own rituals like going to the Russian bath house to take steams/saunas to clear my mind
  Do whatever you can to make sure you‚Äôre mentally well during these times ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919683419942916))
1
- 6. Be thankful for your team
  My team kept a smile on my face during the good and the bad
  Thank you to every member of the Islands team and special shoutout to my CTO @edeng. He gave me a roof above my head when things were rough
  (well, it was an attic, but thats another story) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1380919684346880002))
