- David Senra: 
  I was just talking my friend, Eric Jorgenson, who is the author of the Almanack of Naval, which is the book I give most as a gift before Founders, Jimmy Sony book. He was like, "Dude, I listen to your podcast." He goes, "The more episodes I listened to, I can't help but think I want to ask you. What is David training for? Are you going to found the next Apple? That's what you're doing this for?" I'm like, "No, I'm training for life. 
  David Senra: 
  What I'm trying to figure out, because I never had the personal example is, for a certain personality type, me and you included, to have a contented and satisfied life, we have to be really good at profession. It's not something I'm trying to outsource or get away from. It is a huge part of my personal identity. A lot of my life energy goes into that." But I have read enough examples, Liberty, where people can make billions and be deeply and happily. The best example I give, I think it's episode 168, I don't have it in front of me.

    - Note: This is an important idea to help someone take notes and learn from what they read. What are you hoping to get out of the book? Why are you reading it?
      Personally I'm reading 1. because I love to read but 2. because I'm so young and want to be prepared for situations before I get into them. That way, I can fail less in real life by learning how others who came before me operates and learned.

- It could be a billboard in the middle of Oklahoma. That is not going up until I see it and I approve it. He's demonstrating that with his actions. I just stole that idea. The way I interpreted it when I got to that section of the book. The way I interpreted it is, if you truly believe in your heart, that the product that you made, is capable of making somebody else's life better, then you have a moral obligation to get good at marketing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpf0z3hnfn419pwxe2r5hr71))

- Okay. So I don't have a note-taking app. Everything is in the default note-taking app on Apple. But what I do read... I think of Readwise, the app, as like my second brain. So my process is very simple, I try to not think about anything. I sit down and read a book. If something's interesting to me, I underline it. And then, whatever thought is spawned from that sentence, I write it down on a Post-it note. So if you saw me making the podcast, it looks like I'm doing arts and craft class. I'm sitting here with Post-it notes, scissors, rulers, and pens. And so what I'll do is I'll go through the book one time, that's the process. Then the night before I record, I'll reread all of my notes and highlights in the book. 
  David Senra: 
  And sometimes I have to work off Kindle, I prefer to work off physical books. So that's now the second time that I've read the same highlights. Then I record the podcast, that is the third time I have read the highlights. And this is why I don't outsource anything and I do everything myself, because I'm trying to make a handcrafted product at scale. And I think that resonates with people. So then I've now recorded the podcast, so now I go back through and I edit the podcast myself, which everybody tells me not to do. So now that is the fourth time I have heard and absorbed the highlights. Then the podcast is done, it's published, I sit down with the Readwise app. I talked to this about our mutual friend, Frederik, from Neckar Value. Because he's like, "Dude, how the hell do you get all like...? You have so many..." I have over 20,000 highlights in Readwise.

      3 times, plus I'll have physical copies of them all.

- using a term by Bill Gurley. Just like, "What work do you do that enhances your work when you're not working?" It's a way to think about that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpf1cvk26anbzrz8y1xfb2mh))

- Ed Thorp my personal blueprint. And I recommend everybody read his autobiography, which is A Man for All Markets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpf1f41tzng4t6dqsxqhxtv1))
