A - Ray Bradbury on Feeding Your Creativity

- “I have fed my Muse on equal parts of trash and treasure,” he wrote, and that often included “comic strips, TV shows, books, magazines, newspapers, plays, and films.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnq921z7wncet34kg4vbmv62))

- “People forget that non-algorithmic browsing is still an option,” says [Ann Friedman](https://twitter.com/annfriedman/status/1359200958236876805). “I subscribe to magazines in print and directly visit the websites of publications I like.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnq9bbwfh79w9n65sp6gnmst))

- “It’s all about what you ingest throughout your lifetime that creates what your eye is. Steve Bognar [co-director of ‘American Factory’], many years ago, he just told me, all the stuff you take in throughout your life, you’re creating this gumbo in your head of painting, graphic design, literature, music, it’s all in your head and in that split second [snaps his fingers], unknowing to yourself, all of that is right there. You know it, without knowing it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnq9d8rycsqs2pf8mze1dcvh))

- Toussaint also speaks, in culinary terms, of being a kind of artistic scavenger: “I collect scraps and wishbones and feathers everywhere I go, and then I come home and try and produce a chicken. And it works, and the more extensive travel is, the more I have in my reservoir.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnq9e3z58edrdrt56w49h5q1))

- The only way to find the good stuff, the special stuff, the genuine moments and the true inspiration, is to first engage with the everyday, the mundane, the seemingly useless, the things nobody else seems to care about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnq9npq3nxjdza0byccmsen5))

- I was reminded of chapter six of Twyla Tharp’s *[The Creative Habit](https://amzn.to/2p82D9k)*, entitled, appropriately enough, “Scratching”:
  > You know how you scratch away at a lottery ticket to see if you’ve won? That’s what I’m doing when I begin a piece. **I’m digging through everything to find something.** It’s like clawing the side of a mountain to get a toehold, a grip, some sort of traction to keep moving upward and onward….. Scratching can look like borrowing or appropriating, but it’s an essential part of creativity. It’s primal, and very private. It’s a way of saying to the gods, “Oh, don’t mind me, I’ll just wander around in these back hallways…” and then grabbing that piece of fire and running like hell.
