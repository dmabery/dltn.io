A - The Physical Origin of Universal Computing | Quanta Magazine

- Two characteristics of computers make this flexibility possible. First, computers are programmable. That is, by inputting an appropriate sequence of instructions, we can change a computer’s behavior. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1523084032/20148422))

- Second, computers are universal. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1523084032/20148425))

- Turing also needed to convincingly argue that his universal computer could compute any algorithm whatsoever, including all algorithms that might be discovered in the future. To do this, Turing developed several lines of thought, each giving an informal justification for the idea that his machine could compute any algorithmic process. Yet he was ultimately uncomfortable with the informal nature of his arguments, saying “All arguments which can be given are bound to be, fundamentally, appeals to intuition, and for this reason rather unsatisfactory mathematically.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1523084032/20148438))

- A human being using an abacus to multiply two numbers is obviously profoundly different from a silicon chip running a flight simulator. But both are examples of physical systems, and as such they are governed by the same underlying laws of physics. With this in mind, Deutsch stated the following principle. I’ll use his words — although the language is specialized, it’s actually pretty accessible, and fun to see in the original form:
  Every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1523084032/20148446))

- In other words, take any physical process at all, and you should be able to simulate it using a universal computer. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1523084032/20148453))

- No one has yet managed to deduce this form of Deutsch’s principle from the laws of physics. Part of the reason is that we don’t yet know what the laws of physics are! In particular, we don’t yet know how to combine quantum mechanics with general relativity. And so it’s not clear that we can use computers to simulate processes likely to involve quantum gravity, such as the evaporation of black holes.

- Alan Kay: “In natural science, Nature has given us a world and we’re just to discover its laws. In computers, we can stuff laws into it and create a world.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1523084032/20148508))
