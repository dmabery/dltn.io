A - We Don’t Sell Saddles Here

1
- Just as much as our job is to build something genuinely useful, something which really does make people’s working lives simpler, more pleasant and more productive, our job is also to understand what people think they want and then translate the value of Slack into their terms.

    - Note: Good positioning for the podcast and other FS content in general

- Therefore, “understanding what people think they want and then translating the value of Slack into their terms” *is something we all work on.* It is the sum of the exercise of all our crafts. We do it with copy accompanying signup forms, with fast-loading pages, with good welcome emails, with comprehensive and accurate search, with purposeful loading screens, and with thoughtfully implemented and well-functioning features of all kinds.

- Once the product fits the market, a company is able to step on the gas, spending to promote a product that will actually sell. The things you need to do before are very different from the things you need to do after (generally test & iterate vs scale & optimize).

- So, we should be working carefully from *both* the product end and the market end:
  • Doing a better and better job of providing what people want (whether they know it or not)
  • Communicating the above more and more effectively (so that they know they want it) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0bjm7ddhn3jnnsj53sff66))

- Despite the fact that there are a handful of direct competitors and a muddled history of superficially similar tools, we are setting out to define a new market. And that means we can’t limit ourselves to tweaking the product; we need to tweak the market too ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0bmhkeex15fdq79gfvfw3m))

- We are unlikely to be able to sell “a group chat system” very well: there are just not enough people shopping for group chat system (and, as pointed out elsewhere, our current fax machine works fine).
  > That’s why what we’re selling is *organizational transformation.*
  What we are selling is *not* the software product — the set of all the features, in their specific implementation — because there are just not many buyers for this software product. (People buy “software” to address a need they already know they have or perform some specific task they need to perform, whether that is tracking sales contacts or editing video.)
  However, if we are selling “a reduction in the cost of communication” or “zero effort knowledge management” or “making better decisions, faster” or “all your team communication, instantly searchable, available wherever you go” or “75% less email” or some other valuable *result* of adopting Slack, we will find many more buyers.

    - Note: DbD is not “a twelve step program to make better decisions”
      It’s the way to make sure you’re promoted faster than anyone else - it’s a playbook for whether or not to make that next investment or buy that company - it’s a roadmap to becoming the most trusted person in your organization.

- To see why, consider the hypothetical Acme Saddle Company. They could just sell saddles, and if so, they’d probably be selling on the basis of things like the quality of the leather they use or the fancy adornments their saddles include; they could be selling on the range of styles and sizes available, or on durability, or on price.
  Or, they could sell *horseback riding*. Being successful at selling horseback riding means they grow the market for their product while giving the perfect context for talking about their saddles. It lets them position themselves as the leader and affords them different kinds of marketing and promotion opportunities (e.g., sponsoring school programs to promote riding to kids, working on land conservation or trail maps). It lets them think big and potentially be big.

- My favorite recent example is Lululemon: when they started, there was not a large market for yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories. They sold yoga like crazy: helping people find yoga studios near their homes, hosting free classes, sponsorships and scholarships, local ambassadors and training, etc. And as a result, they sold just under $1.4 billion worth of yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories in their most recent fiscal year ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0bw9qv9gmm2mhs7ae9fkqy))

- The reason for saying we need to do ‘an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution’ is this: When you want something really bad, you will put up with a lot of flaws. But if you do not yet know you want something, your tolerance will be much lower. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0c076r31x1ttv1m2fkwbj8))

- Life is too short to do mediocre work and it is definitely too short to build shitty things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0cbew0r7b6hzjdmxk731tb))

- The answer to “Why?” is “because why the fuck else would you even want to be alive but to do things as well as you can?”. Now: let’s do this ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0cdx2cmg2n81eb8w6ss5xg))
