A - The Principles of Patience

1
- **1. “Develop a taste for having problems.”**
  Burkeman quotes the French poet Christian Bobin:
  > I was peeling a red apple from the garden when I suddenly understood that life would only ever give me a series of wonderfully insoluble problems. With that thought, an ocean of profound peace entered my heart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhxcgrggw49wv65vh95vayca))

- **2. “Embrace radical incrementalism.”**
  People who work *a little bit every day* tend to cultivate [the patience it takes to get good](https://austinkleon.com/2018/09/20/a-willingness-to-be-bad/). These people also quit their day’s work when it’s finished: they identify what their chunk of time or task is per day, they do that and only that, and save more for tomorrow. (See: “[Something small, every day](https://austinkleon.com/2013/12/29/something-small-every-day/)” and the “Chain-smoking” chapter of [*Show Your Work!*](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work)) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhxch2h6qqe682x3qr1gg90r))

- **3. “More often than not, originality lies on the far side of unoriginality.”**
  To illustrate this point, Burkeman uses [The Helsinki Bus Station Theory](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/23/change-life-helsinki-bus-station-theory). (The original speech is [here](http://www.fotocommunity.com/info/Helsinki_Bus_Station_Theory).) As the photographer Arno Minkkinen explained, Helsinki bus lines start out traveling the same path but then diverge at different points in the route, spreading out to far and wide locales. When you find your work resembles someone else’s, or you’re on someone else’s bus, traveling someone else’s path, don’t try to go back to the bus station at the very beginning and completely reinvent yourself and start from scratch, keep working and “stay on the bus!” At a certain point, your path will split off into something new. (I wrote a book about this called [*Steal Like An Artist*](https://austinkleon.com/steal/).) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhxchbcv0pq999tv1avsqy9a))
