A - What Can We Learn From Barnes & Noble's Surprising Turnaround?

1
- But Barnes & Noble is flourishing. After a long decline, the company is profitable and growing again—and last week announced [plans to open 30 new stores](https://bookriot.com/barnes-noble-opening-30-stores-in-2023/). In some instances, they are taking over locations where Amazon tried (and failed) to operate bookstores. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhpnsqs28byznpdfg101pna))

- It’s amazing how much difference a new boss can make. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhps1t9t1vb9m2w9dajb2dg))

- I’ve seen that firsthand so many times. I now have a rule of thumb: “There is no substitute for good decisions at the top—and no remedy for stupid ones.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhps5zabrftjsmgpsrsx91k))

- But the most amazing thing Daunt did at Waterstones was this: [He refused to take any promotional money from publishers](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/cfp-blog/2016/02/26/five-waterstones-sort-of-myths-explained/).
  This seemed stark raving mad. But Daunt had a reason. Publishers give you promotional money in exchange for purchase commitments and prominent placement—but once you take the cash, you’ve made your deal with the devil. You now must put stacks of the promoted books in the most visible parts of the store, and sell them like they’re the holy script of some new cure-all creed.

- Daunt refused to play this game. He wanted to put the best books in the window. He wanted to display the most exciting books by the front door. Even more amazing, [he let the people working in the stores make these decisions](https://www.wearetogethr.io/localisation-strategy-post-covid/).
  This is James Daunt’s super power: He loves books.
  “Staff are now in control of their own shops,” he explained. “Hopefully they’re enjoying their work more. They’re creating something very different in each store.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhpvzc5j1gnad9xxkhjg205))

- Daunt also refused to dumb-down the store offerings. The key challenge, he claimed was to “create an environment that’s intellectually satisfying—and not in a snobbish way, but in the sense of feeding your mind.”
  That’s an extraordinary thing to hear from a corporate CEO. Daunt wanted to run a bookstore that was “intellectually satisfying” and “feeds your mind.” The first time I heard an interview with him, I decided I trusted James Daunt. I wanted him to succeed. But the odds seemed stacked against him. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhpxp43ff9399bkx43qknrz))

- The turnaround has delivered remarkable results. Barnes & Noble opened 16 new bookstores in 2022, and now will double that pace of openings in 2023. In a year of collapsing digital platforms, this 136-year-old purveyor of print media is enjoying boom times. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhpyh69drrhmme3hxamm1r0))

- **If you want to sell music, you must love those songs**. If you want to succeed in journalism, you must love those newspapers. If you want to succeed in movies, you must love the cinema. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhpyq3av8fpgvjfjnxebd7k))
1
- But here’s the problem. If you don’t really love the music (or books or newspapers or cinema or whatever), those cash flow projections turn out to be wrong. That’s because creative fields like music and writing live and die based on creativity, not financial statements and branding deals.

- That’s a strategy that others could learn from. Although I’m not sure you can teach it.
  You don’t fall in love for logical reasons, and you could never convince someone else to do so on the basis of arguments. People either feel it or they don’t. That’s true whether you love your spouse or you love something more intangible like a song or a book or a movie.
  But even if you can’t teach this kind of love, you know it when you see it. There are people who are passionate about these things. They believe in them with ardor and devotion. You can find them and hire these people—and those are the individuals you can trust. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnhq15qerjwq58ja13ajx6nm))
