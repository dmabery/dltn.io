- “It is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which vital,” the journal quotes Holmes. “Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated.” ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=44))

- But this one would be different. Tentatively titled A Tangled Skein, it featured a character named Ormond Sacker and “a sleepy-eyed young man” called either Sheridan Hope or Sherrinford Holmes. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=69))

- In 1876, Doyle enrolled as a medical student at the University of Edinburgh, where he met the man who would change his life. On his first day in Dr. Joseph Bell’s class, Doyle watched the professor hold up a vial filled with amber liquid. “This, gentlemen, contains a most potent drug,” Bell said. “It is extremely bitter to the taste. Now, I wish to see how many of you have developed the powers of observation that God granted you.” Opening the vial, Bell stirred the liquid with his finger. “As I don’t ask anything of my students which I wouldn’t do alone with myself, I will taste it before passing it around.” He licked his finger and grimaced at the seemingly unpleasant taste. Then he passed the vial around. Would Doyle meet the challenge? When it was his turn, he tasted the liquid. But neither Doyle nor his classmates proved to have what Bell was looking for. “Gentlemen,” the professor said, “I am deeply grieved to find that not one of you has developed his power of perception, the faculty of observation which I speak so much of, for if you had truly observed me, you would have seen that, while I placed my index finger in the awful brew, it was my middle finger—aye—which somehow found its way into my mouth.” This would prove to be the first of many such challenges.

- “Reading some detective stories, I was struck by the fact that their results were obtained in nearly every case by chance,” he later wrote. “I thought I would try my hand at writing a story in which the hero would treat crime as Dr. Bell treated disease and where science would take the place of romance.” ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=122))

- “Anatomy, chemistry, mathematics, British law, and sensational literature are but a few areas of his vast sphere of knowledge,” according to Otto Penzler, proprietor of the Mysterious Bookshop in New York City. “Although he is admittedly not well versed in such subjects as astronomy, philosophy, and politics.” ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=148))

- “Silver Blaze,” for instance, contains arguably the most famous passage in the Holmes canon—an exchange between a police inspector and the great detective: “Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?” “To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.” “The dog did nothing in the night-time.” “That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.

- “I was amazed at the concern expressed by the public,” said Doyle. “I have been much maligned for doing this gentleman to death. But I hold that it was not murder, but justifiable homicide in self-defense, since if I had not killed him, he would certainly have killed me.” ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=360))

- “I had been delayed, and he was passing the time by reading the paper,” Doyle later wrote. “He held the paper close to his eyes and rather sideways, proving not only a high degree of myopia, but marked astigmatism. The idea of such a man scouring fields at night and assaulting cattle while avoiding the watching police was ludicrous.” ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=481))

- Toward the end of his life, he drew a picture of himself as a workhorse pulling a cart piled with bags marked with words that represented his life’s work—lectures, travels, poetry, plays, politics, and historical novels. But the biggest sack sat on the very top, outweighing all the others. It was labeled “Sherlock Holmes.” ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=562))

- R. STONEHOUSE/CAMERA PRESS/REDUX IN 2004, A LONG-LOST Doyle archive—including the items shown here—was auctioned by Christie’s in London. Though the British Library secured much of the material (including the manuscript of Doyle’s first novel, The Narrative of John Smith), the institution expressed regret that many valuable papers were dispersed in private hands.

- Among the standout post-Doyle literary works, Klinger singles out two novels: The Giant Rat of Sumatra (1976) by Richard L. Boyer and Dust and Shadow (2009) by Faye, while Faye herself recommends The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1974) by Nicholas Meyer: “It’s a book about addiction and loss and recovery, and it’s remarkable,” she says. Otto Penzler recommends the Moriarty series by John Gardner and Anthony Horowitz’s The House of Silk (2011). “Quite a few short stories do it well, too,” he adds, “notably Vincent Starrett’s ‘The Unique Hamlet.’” (Starrett also wrote the often-quoted 1942 poem that beautifully sums up the appeal of Sherlock Holmes’s world: “Here, though the world explode, these two survive, / And it is always eighteen ninety-five.”) ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N2WVXHQ&location=709))
