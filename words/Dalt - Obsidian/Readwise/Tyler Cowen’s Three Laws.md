A - Tyler Cowen’s Three Laws

1
- 1. **Cowen’s First Law**: There is something wrong with everything (by which I mean there are few decisive or knockdown articles or arguments, and furthermore until you have found the major flaws in an argument, you do not understand it).
  2. **Cowen’s Second Law**: There is a literature on everything.
  3. **Cowen’s Third Law**: All propositions about real interest rates are wrong.
  I coined those some time ago, when teaching macroeconomics, yet I remain amazed how often I see blog posts which violate all three laws within the span of a few paragraphs.
  There is of course a common thread to all three laws, namely you should not have too much confidence in your own judgment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr80bsxcaeem9g9ahhm7fqr8))
