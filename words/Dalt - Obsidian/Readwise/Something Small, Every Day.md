A - Something Small, Every Day

1
- Focus on *days*.
  The day is the only unit of time that I can really get my head around. Seasons change, weeks are completely human-made, but the day has a rhythm. The sun goes up; the sun goes down. I can handle that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqkd88anyzx9h124g17dw2))

- Anyone can fight the battles of just one day. It is only when you and I add the battles of those two awful eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that we break down. It is not the experience of today that drives us mad. It is the remorse or bitterness for something that happened yesterday or the dread of what tomorrow may bring. Let us therefore do our best to live but one day at a time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqmspyc2ja6xnp2qjpexqp))

- Building a body of work (or a life) is all about the slow accumulation of a day’s worth of effort over time. Writing a page each day doesn’t seem like much, but do it for 365 days and you have enough to fill a novel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqn1hfevp0z5dkvh2q9vqe))

- But it doesn’t matter to me whether the day’s poem was good or not, what matters is that it got done. I did the work. I didn’t break the chain. If I have a shitty day, I go to sleep and know that tomorrow I get to take another whack at it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqp417vfsmhw0kj61esks9))

- Anyways, if you make a New Year’s resolution, make it this: **something small, *every day*.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqprcj5gtag9jkzj6d9zav))

- Figure out what your little daily chunk of work is, and every day, no matter what, make sure it gets done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqq0b1bfpv8929ys9xp420))

- People often ask me, “How do you find the time for the work?” And I answer, “I look for it.” You find time the same place you find spare change: in the nooks and crannies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqqadh2hg4j7c80spdnjw7))

- Get up early and work for a couple hours on the thing you really care about ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqsjxc752hgw5nwn3836hx))

- And should you start to despair at your progress, always keep in mind the words of Harvey Pekar: “Every day is a new deal. Keep working and maybe something will turn up.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnqqt1eqrn66e88sbte9e3c6))
