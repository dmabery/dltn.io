A - Reading Well

1
- Reading is letting someone else model the world for you. This is an act of intimacy. When the author is morose, you become morose. When he is mirthful, eventually you may share in it. And after finishing a very good book one is driven a little mad, forced to return from a world that no one nearby has witnessed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ehx2qp23as35dmvy9t3ka5))

    - Note: “Forced to return to a world” - Yes! After finishing a great book, all I want to do is talk to someone about it, or at least ramble long enough with someone who will ask decent questions and remain interested, but this rarely happens.

- If you read what is excellent you will not suddenly become excellent, but a life that is sown with stories is one better positioned to think and dream. The more stories, the more likely one is to understand and identify all the influences that act upon oneself in life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ej0644d5yw2fwgcgqmvf23))

- *He who has no poetry in himself will find poetry in nothing.* A person that reads no stories is unready for life. A person that reads many stories will be open to yet more stories. The appetite grows by what it feeds on. Dine as best you can. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ej0gk303ma0n3gvdw53zgb))
