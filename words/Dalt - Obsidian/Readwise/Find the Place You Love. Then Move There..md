A - Find the Place You Love. Then Move There.

- There is a word for love of a place: *topophilia*, [popularized](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780231073950) by the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan in 1974 as all of “the human being’s affective ties with the material environment.” In other words, it is the warm feelings you get from a place. It is a vivid, emotional, and personal experience, and it leads to unexplainable affections. One of my fellow Seattle natives made this point to me when he said he hated the rain in Boston but not Seattle. Why? “Only Seattle rain is nice.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1x39ebeaahk96vbww2vf8v1))

- In his book [*A Reenchanted World*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780805078350), the sociologist James William Gibson defines topophilia as a spiritual connection, especially with nature. Oladele Ogunseitan, a microbiologist at the University of California at Irvine, [demonstrates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277856/) topophilia by showing that people are attracted to both objective and subjective—even unconscious—criteria. My friend’s affinity for the “Seattle rain” is probably fueled by what Ogunseitan calls “synesthetic tendency,” or the way particular, ordinary sensory perceptions affect our memory and emotions. If the smell of a fresh-cooked pie, the sound of a train whistle at night, or the feeling of a crisp autumn wind evokes a visceral memory of a particular place, you are experiencing a synesthetic tendency.
