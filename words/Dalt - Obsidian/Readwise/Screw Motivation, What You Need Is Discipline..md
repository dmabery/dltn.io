A - Screw Motivation, What You Need Is Discipline.

1
- Motivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional state is necessary to complete a task. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407581))
1
- Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407583))
1
- Successful completion of tasks brings about the inner states that chronic procrastinators think they need to initiate tasks in the first place. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407588))

- Put in simpler form, you don’t wait until you’re in olympic form to start training. You train to get into olympic form. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407591))

- chasing motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing things we feel like doing. The problem is then framed thus: “How do I get myself to feel like doing what I have rationally decided to do?” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407599))
1
- The point is to cut the link between feelings and actions, and do it anyway. You get to feel good and buzzed and energetic and eager afterwards. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407608))

- The worst thing that can happen is succeeding at the wrong thing – temporarily. A far superior scenario is retaining sanity, which unfortunately tends to be misinterpreted as moral failure: “I still don’t love my pointless paper-shuffling job, I must be doing something wrong.” “I still prefer cake to brocolli and can’t lose weight, maybe I’m just weak” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407619))

- For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407629))

- In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407630))

- Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355663317/14407636))

- How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a positive feedback loop.
