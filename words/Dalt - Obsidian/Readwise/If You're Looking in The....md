T - If You're Looking in The...

1
- If you're looking in the right places, the internet is a treasure trove.
  The best internet gems you've never heard of: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485354599091367937))
1
- I'll share 20+ tools, so I'll start by breaking them into 4 categories.
  Tools that:
  ‚Ä¢ Give perspective
  ‚Ä¢ You can play with
  ‚Ä¢ Center around data
  ‚Ä¢ Can help creators
  The common theme across all is that no one "needed" to make them, but we're all better off bc someone did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485354600550993920))
1
- 1. Let's start with tools that give perspective!
  These often solicit both of these reactions:
  ‚Ä¢ Who the hell made this?!
  ‚Ä¢ I love that person
  For example, this site which puts into perspective just how much a billion dollars is.
  Hint: It's a lot.

- 2. Here's another fun one: emojis to scale
  Get a sense of how the emojis that you use every day, compare in size IRL...
  From the 3mm mosquito ü¶ü to the 9500000000000km Milky Way üåå

1
- 3. Speaking of mosquitos, did you know that they're the most deadly animal in the world?
  I bet you also didn't know that eating 1k üçå is more dangerous than a ü¶ò encounter.
  Thankfully, this graphic maps out our likelihood of death.
  The more you know...

- 4. Death is depressing. So are pessimists.
  @PessimistsArc has put together a wonderful gallery of the headlines from the past, regarding technology that people feared.
  What did they fear? Nearly everything.
  Even teddy bears. üêª

1
- 5. Can you measure pessimism through time?
  The @hedonometer tracks the happiness of Twitter, through sentiment analysis.
  When were we happiest?
  Apparently, 2015.

1
- 6. Speaking of happiness, there's one thing that has a 99% correlation with mine.
  It's food.
  The https://t.co/A1tiZSkw4y is a wonderful tool that documents when foods were discovered, from the üê∏ to the test tube üçî.
  https://t.co/Wp2UgZjNqs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355221144698880))
1
- 7. If you've ever wondered WTH constitutes as a sandwich, The Cube Rule has you covered.
  The jury has spoken:
  ‚Ä¢ A quesadilla is a sandwich
  ‚Ä¢ A slice of pie is a taco
  ‚Ä¢ Cheesecake is a quiche
  ‚Ä¢ A dumpling is a calzone
  ‚Ä¢ Mashed potatoes are a salad

1
- 8. For another site that gives perspective, I'll share something that I built!
  A site of 500+ untranslatable words.
  A couple favourites:
  Abendrot üá©üá™: The colour of the sky during sunset
  Petrichor üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø: The smell of earth after rain
  https://t.co/EVStUNi6Db ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355226185945090))
1
- 9. Finally, one more site that gives perspective... from above. üõ∏
  The yearly drone awards, honoring categories including from urban, wildlife, sport, people, nature, and more.
  Do yourself a favor and check it out.
  https://t.co/c5bC5VBMmx ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355227259629569))
1
- 10. Onto sites that you can play with.
  We'll start with https://t.co/XgkFdWCblT
  This site challenges you to see what you can make with 140 characters of Javascript.
  The results are INCREDIBLE.
  And they're also surprisingly easy to create.
  https://t.co/8dGPyhPM5b ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355228723499012))
1
- 11. Another one that'll boggle your mind: this fluid simulation tool.
  I challenge you to not play with this for at least a few minutes.
  Works on mobile too.
  https://t.co/31Z94NH26v ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355230963191809))
1
- 12. If you're bored of looking out the same window every day, you can adopt another with @windowswap.
  And if you don't like that one, just shuffle to another.
  Travel the world, without the airport security. üôÇ
  https://t.co/TtMCxRQpKS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355868111532039))
1
- 13. While you're at it, might as well learn a language.
  Instead of having to commit to learning goals that you'll never stick to, @JoinToucan lets you learn languages passively while you're browsing.
  It's very bueno.
  https://t.co/K34oMGHmBA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355869772517376))
1
- 14. Onto data tools. To start, I want to slip in a friendly reminder:
  Take a minute to understand how many FB third-party sites are tracking you. (A lot)
  If you want, turn them off with a click.
  The thread shares the same for Google & Twitter.
  https://t.co/Mpy2bHgGPX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355871588651009))
1
- 15. Everyone uses Google. Almost no one uses Google Ngram.
  Ngram indexed text from a huge # of books, printed from 1500 to 2008.
  Use this data to understand how the frequency of words have changed (like priority vs priorities)...and also shaped society.
  https://t.co/e8xIsxdS7d ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355873174122496))
1
- 16. If we're talking data, we HAVE to talk Reddit.
  As a top 20 site, the amount of value on the platform is insane.
  To start, here are some of my favourite subreddits.
  If you go explore one, make it r/dataisbeautiful.
  https://t.co/mWGFe9A8Zp ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355874705047553))
1
- 17. If you have a favourite subreddit, dump it in Subreddit Stats.
  It'll allow you to sift through the noise and see what the best posts of all time were.
  You'll also be able to see:
  ‚Ä¢ How quickly its grown
  ‚Ä¢ Popular keywords
  ‚Ä¢ Related subreddits
  https://t.co/u0UjM5S629 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355876152066049))
1
- 18. Speaking of subreddits, this might be my favourite tool on the web üëá
  It allows you to visually see the how subreddits relate.
  Try something like "r/herbalism" and you'll find all types:
  ‚Ä¢ r/mushroom-hunting
  ‚Ä¢ r/drugnerds
  ‚Ä¢ r/babywitch
  https://t.co/jfnChgUBTg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355877720748032))
1
- 19. Going down these Reddit rabbit holes will often surface the most interesting things.
  For example, one of my deep dives surfaced this list of 27k open salaries (and growing)
  Side note: someone sign me up for turnip farming...
  https://t.co/YE9HywWaIO ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355879398461444))
1
- 20. A similar tool also exists for podcasts!
  Use @getrephonic to find new podcasts that are tangential to the podcasts that you already know and love.
  https://t.co/dn2B3SpyMk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355881193619457))
1
- 21. If you like data, you're probably also obsessed with moving infographics.
  There are several sites that let you make these on your own, like @f_l_o_u_r_i_s_h
  https://t.co/myHbtIaLG9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485355882955243520))
1
- 22. Since we're talking data, I encourage you to bookmark @OurWorldInData.
  One of the premier sources of high-quality information, curated in a digestible way.
  Their work really puts things into perspective...
  https://t.co/ooXaf6eicG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485357103589986310))
1
- 23. Onto the final section: tools for creators
  Let's start with the harsh reality that most creators fail.
  But, it's the "successful" ones that get back up.
  I love @Shpigford's page that shares all 62 of his creations since 2003 and where they went.
  https://t.co/b4wa2LUSPD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485357104869216257))
1
- 24. If you're just starting to create online, take a deep breath and remember:
  Even the biggest companies in the world started somewhere.
  @FirstVersions is a great site that showcases the early days of sites from Nike to Amazon to Coca Cola.
  https://t.co/KMaht9LUb1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485357106316275712))
1
- 25. Remember, building products should be fun.
  If you're looking for a lol, check out the https://t.co/oGgNu5AhS0
  This site takes "ideas are worthless" to a new level. üòÇ

1
- 26. For the human equivalent, I present @mattyxb, creator at Unnecessary Inventions
  (IMO one of the most creative sites online...)
  His shop tagline? "The brand no one asked for"
  Perhaps his most hilarious production...the backpack fidget spinner üëá
  https://t.co/9rVtFqq1vy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1485357112100208642))
1
- OK, that's all for now.
  Will likely add to this list as I discover more.
  What're your best internet gems that more ppl should know about?
  PS: If you're like me and overwhelmed w the amount stuff online, here's a bonus hack for you.
  Expiring todos! ‚ö°Ô∏è
