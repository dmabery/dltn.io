B - What&#39;s Our Problem?

1
- The problem with people is that they're only human. – Bill Watterson ([Location 42](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=42))
1
- The worrying thing about that quote is that the philosopher Edmund Burke issued the same warning over a century earlier, in 1790: People will not look forward to posterity, who never look backward to their ancestors.2 ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=97))

- The Ladder is a thinking lens—a pair of glasses for the brain to help us better understand the world and ourselves. It’s made me a much better thinker and communicator, and I hope it will do the same for you. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=138))

- There is a great deal of human nature in people. – Mark Twain ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=158))

- You know how moths inanely fly toward light and you’re not really sure why they do this or what their angle is? It turns out that for millions of years, moths have used moonlight as a beacon for nocturnal navigation—which works great until a bunch of people start turning lights on at night that aren’t the moon. The moth’s brain software hasn’t had time to update itself to the new situation, and now millions of moths are wasting their lives flapping around streetlights.

- But when something riles up the Primitive Mind, it gets bigger and stronger. Its torch—which bears the primal fires of our genes’ will for survival—grows as well, filling our minds with smoky fog. This fog dulls our consciousness, so when we’re most under the spell of our Primitive Mind, we don’t even realize it’s happening. The Higher Mind, unable to think clearly, begins directing its efforts toward supporting whatever the Primitive Mind wants to do, whether it makes sense or not. When we slip down to the Ladder’s low rungs, we’re short-sighted and small-minded, thinking and acting with our pettiest emotions. We’re low on self-awareness and high on hypocrisy. We’re our worst selves. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=229))
1
- Why do we believe what we believe? Our beliefs make up our perception of reality, drive our behavior, and shape our life stories. History happened the way it did because of what people believed in the past, and what we believe today will write the story of our future. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=241))

- So the Higher Mind’s goal is to get to the truth, while the Primitive Mind’s goal is confirmation of its existing beliefs. These two very different types of intellectual motivation exist simultaneously in our heads. This means that our driving intellectual motivation—and, in turn, our thinking process—varies depending on where we are on the Ladder at any given moment. In the realm of thinking, then, the Ladder’s four rungs correspond to four ways of forming beliefs. When your Higher Mind is running the show, you’re up on the top rung, thinking like a Scientist. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=262))
1
- The Scientist’s default position on any topic is “I don’t know.” To advance beyond Point A, they have to put in effort, starting with the first stage: hypothesis formation. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=272))
1
- But when Scientists want to learn something new, they try to soak up a wide variety of information on the topic. The Scientist seeks out ideas across the Idea Spectrum, even those that seem likely to be wrong—because knowing the range of viewpoints that exist about the topic is a key facet of understanding the topic. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=279))

- So skilled thinkers work hard to master the art of skepticism. A thinker who believes everything they hear is too gullible, and their beliefs become packed with a jumble of falsehoods, misconceptions, and contradictions. Someone who trusts no one is overly cynical, even paranoid, and limited to gaining new information only by direct experience. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=294))
1
- The Scientist’s default skepticism position would be somewhere in between, with a filter just tight enough to consistently identify and weed out bullshit, just open enough to let in the truth. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=296))
1
- Thinking like a Scientist isn’t about knowing a lot, it’s about being aware of what you do and don’t know—about staying close to this dotted line as you learn: ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=332))

- Weird things happen to your thinking when the drive for truth is infected by some ulterior motive. Psychologists call it “motivated reasoning.” I like to think of it as Reasoning While Motivated—the thinking equivalent of drunk driving. As the 6th century Chinese Zen master Seng-ts’an explains: If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between “for” and “against” is the mind’s worst disease.2 When you’re thinking like ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=345))

- Rung 3: Thinking like an Attorney ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=383))
1
- When you’re thinking like an Attorney, you don’t start at Point A at all. You start at Point B. The client is not guilty. Now let’s figure out why. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=390))
1
- If someone really wants to believe something—that the Earth is flat, that 9/11 was orchestrated by Americans, that the CIA is after them—the human brain will find a way to make that belief seem perfectly clear and irrefutable. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=400))
1
- For the Attorney, the hypothesis formation stage is really a belief-strengthening process. They inevitably end up with the same viewpoints they started with, now beefed up with a refreshed set of facts and arguments that remind them just how right they are. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=402))
1
- The result of thinking like an Attorney is that your brain’s incredible ability to learn new things is mostly shut down. Even worse, your determination to confirm your existing beliefs leaves you confident about a bunch of things that aren’t true. Your efforts only make you more delusional. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=407))

- Rung 4: Thinking like a Zealot ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=415))
1
- This is the relationship Zealots have with their sacred ideas: the ideas aren’t rugged experiments to be kicked around, they’re fragile, precious babies to be adored and protected. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=419))
1
- When Zealots argue, things can quickly get heated, because for someone who identifies with their ideas, a challenge to those ideas feels like an insult. It feels personally invalidating. A punch landed on a Zealot’s idea is a punch landed on their baby. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=427))
1
- Idea Labs place a high regard on humility, and saying “I don’t know” usually wins trust and respect. When someone who often says “I don’t know” does express conviction about a viewpoint, it really means something, and others will take it to heart without too much skepticism needed—which saves the listener time and effort. Likewise, unearned conviction is a major no-no in an Idea Lab. So someone with a reputation for bias or arrogance or dishonesty will be met with a high degree of skepticism, no matter how much conviction they express. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=480))
1
- People in an Idea Lab don’t usually take arguments personally because Idea Lab culture is built around the core notion that people and ideas are separate things. People are meant to be respected, ideas are meant to be batted around and picked apart. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=491))
1
- A culture that treats ideas like sacred objects incentivizes entirely different behavior than the Idea Lab. In an Echo Chamber, falling in line with the rest of the group is socially rewarded. It’s a common activity to talk about how obviously correct the sacred ideas are—it’s how you express your allegiance to the community and prove your own intellectual and moral worth. Humility ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTJCTR58&location=514))
1
- Idea Labs can simultaneously respect a person and disrespect the person’s ideas. But Echo Chambers equate a person’s ideas with their identity, so respecting a person and respecting their ideas are one and the same. Disagreeing with someone in an Echo Chamber is seen not as intellectual exploration but as rudeness, making an argument about ideas indistinguishable from a fight.
