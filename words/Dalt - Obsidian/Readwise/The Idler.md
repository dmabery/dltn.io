A - The Idler

1
- A characteristic of the idler's work is that it looks suspiciously like play. This, again, makes the non-idler feel uncomfortable. Victims of the [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic) would like all work to be unpleasant. They feel that work is a curse, that we must suffer on this earth to earn our place in the next. The idler, on the other hand, sees no reason not to use his brain to organise a life for himself where his play is his work, and so attempt to create his own little paradise in the here and now.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idler_(1993)#cite_note-Hammond2010-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmh1bacwq1ddm0pcdw8j3bc2))
