B - I'm OK--You're OK

1
- Freud’s definition of psychoanalysis as a “dynamic conception which reduces mental life to an interplay of reciprocally urging and checking forces.” ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=202))
1
- What I hope to demonstrate in this book is a new way to state old ideas and a clear way to present new ones, not as an inimical or deprecating assault on the work of the past, but rather as a means of meeting the undeniable evidence that the old methods do not seem to be working very well. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=223))
1
- The purpose of this book is not only the presentation of new data but also an answer to the question of why people do not ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=229))

- One of Penfield’s significant conclusions was that the electrode evoked a single recollection, not a mixture of memories or a generalization. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=268))
1
- Perhaps the most significant discovery was that not only past events are recorded in detail but also the feelings that were associated with those events. An event and the feeling which was produced by the event are inextricably locked together in the brain so that one cannot be evoked without the other. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=273))
1
- Thus, evoked recollection is not the exact photographic or phonographic reproduction of past scenes or events. It is reproduction of what the patient saw and heard and felt and understood. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=277))
1
- sequence in involuntary recollections is: (1) reliving (spontaneous, involuntary feeling), and (2) remembering (conscious, voluntary thinking about the past event thus relived). Much of what we relive we cannot remember! ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=283))
1
- It would seem she was now consciously remembering a feeling which initially was the reliving of a feeling. In the second instance, she remembered how it was to feel that way; but in the first instance, the feeling was precisely the same feeling which was recorded when her mother died. She was at that moment five years old. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=295))
1
- the memory record continues intact even after the subject’s ability to recall it disappears: ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=308))
1
- The evoking of complicated memory sequences makes it seem plausible that each of the memories we can recall has a separate neurone pathway. Particularly significant to our understanding of how the past influences the present is the observation that the temporal cortex is obviously utilized in the interpretation of current experience. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=325))
1
- The brain functions as a high-fidelity tape recorder. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=345))
1
- The feelings which were associated with past experiences also are recorded and are inextricably locked to those experiences. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=346))
1
- Persons can exist in two states at the same time. The patient knew he was on the operating table talking with Penfield; he equally knew he was seeing the “Seven-Up Bottling Company . . . and Harrison Bakery.” He was dual in that he was at the same time in the experience and outside of it, observing it. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=347))
1
- These recorded experiences and feelings associated with them are available for replay today in as vivid a form as when they happened and provide much of the data which determines the nature of today’s transactions. These experiences not only can be recalled but also relived. I not only remember how I felt. I feel the same way now. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=350))

- Eric Berne, the originator of Transactional Analysis, ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=364))
1
- The unit of social intercourse is called a transaction. If two or more people encounter each other . . . sooner or later one of them will speak, or give some other indication of acknowledging the presence of the others. This is called the transactional stimulus. Another person will then say or do something which is in some way related to the stimulus, and that is called the transactional response. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=365))
1
- Transactional Analysis is the method of examining this one transaction wherein “I do something to you and you do something back” and determining which part of the multiple-natured individual is “coming on.” ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=369))
1
- This language is clearly one of the most important developments of the system. Agreement on the meanings of words plus agreement on what to examine are the two keys which have unlocked the door to the “mysteries of why people do as they do.” ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=373))
1
- Changes from one state to another are apparent in manner, appearance, words, and gestures. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=438))
1
- one of a small child dominated by feelings, one of a self-righteous parent, and one of a reasoning, logical, grown-up woman and mother of three children. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=445))
1
- These states of being are not roles but psychological realities. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=450))
1
- The Parent is a huge collection of recordings in the brain of unquestioned or imposed external events perceived by a person in his early years, a period which we have designated roughly as the first five years of life. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=454))
1
- The data in the Parent was taken in and recorded “straight” without editing. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=460))
1
- Fig. 2. The Parent. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=467))
1
- Another characteristic of the Parent is the fidelity of the recordings of inconsistency. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=489))
1
- This is what happens when the Parent contains discordant material. The Parent is repressed or, in the extreme, blocked out altogether. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=495))
1
- The how to comprises a vast body of data acquired by watching the parents. It is largely useful data which makes it possible for the little person to learn to get along by himself. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=505))
1
- A person whose early instructions were accompanied by stern intensity may find it more difficult to examine the old ways and may hang onto them long after they are useful, having developed a compulsion to do it “this way and no other.” ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=507))
1
- Any external situation in which the little person feels himself to be dependent to the extent that he is not free to question or to explore produces data which is stored in the Parent. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=538))
1
- This is the recording of internal events, the responses of the little person to what he sees and hears. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=542))
1
- In this connection it is important to recall Penfield’s observation that the subject feels again the emotion which the situation originally produced in him, and he is aware of the same interpretations, true or false, which he himself gave to the experience in the first place. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=543))
1
- evoked recollection is not the exact photographic or phonographic reproduction of past scenes or events. It is reproduction of what the patient saw and heard and felt and understood.2 ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=545))

- Fig. 3. The Child. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=552))
1
- The predominant by-product of the frustrating, civilizing process is negative feelings. On the basis of these feelings the little person early concludes, “I’m not OK.” We call this comprehensive self-estimate the NOT OK, or the NOT OK Child. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=558))
1
- Therefore, when a person is in the grip of feelings, we say his Child has taken over. When his anger dominates his reason, we say his Child is in command. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=573))
1
- believe that by the time the child leaves the home for his first independent social experience—school—he has been exposed to nearly every possible attitude and admonition of his parents, and thenceforth further parental communications are essentially a reinforcement of what has already been recorded. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=586))
1
- Adult data accumulates as a result of the child’s ability to find out for himself what is different about life from the “taught concept” of life in his Parent and the “felt concept” of life in his Child. The Adult develops a “thought concept” of life based on data gathering and data processing. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=606))
1
- Fig. 4. Gradual emergence of the Adult beginning at ten months. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=615))
1
- The Adult is “principally concerned with transforming stimuli into pieces of information, and processing and filing that information on the basis of previous experience. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=616))
1
- Through the Adult the little person can begin to tell the difference between life as it was taught and demonstrated to him (Parent), life as he felt it or wished it or fantasied it (Child), and life as he figures it out by himself (Adult). ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=620))
1
- age. A secure youngster is one who finds that most Parent data is reliable: “They told me the truth!” ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=628))
1
- parental directives are grounded in reality, the child, through his own Adult, will come to realize integrity, or a sense of wholeness. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=632))
1
- It is important to emphasize that the verification of Parent data does not erase the NOT OK recordings in the Child, which were produced by the early imposition of this data. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=637))
1
- We cannot erase the recording, but we can choose to turn it off! In ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=643))
1
- the same way that the Adult updates Parent data to determine what is valid and what is not, it updates Child data to determine which feelings may be expressed safely. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=643))
1
- Yet both crying and screaming are emotions in the Child. The Adult keeps emotional expression appropriate. The Adult’s function in updating the Parent and Child is diagramed in Figure 6. The Adult within the Adult in this figure refers to updated reality data. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=646))
1
- Unrealistic, irrational, non-Adult responses are seen in a condition referred to as traumatic neurosis. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=663))
1
- An extremely time-consuming conflict is produced when what parents say is true does not seem to be true to the Adult. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=690))
1
- This type of dream material lends support to the assumption that our earliest experiences, though ineffable, are recorded and do replay in the present. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=742))
1
- Transactional Analysis constructs the following classification of the four possible life positions held with respect to oneself and others: 1. I’M NOT OK—YOU’RE OK 2. I’M NOT OK—YOU’RE NOT OK 3. I’M OK—YOU’RE NOT OK 4. I’M OK—YOU’RE OK ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=799))

- Schopler6 concludes there is a physiological factor which combines with insufficient stroking to produce the autistic child. The factor is thought to be a high stimulus barrier so that the stroking which is given does not register. He may not be totally deprived of stroking, but he may be deprived of his sensation of it, or an “accumulation” of his sensations of it. The infant is then seen by the parents as a nonresponsive child (he doesn’t like to be held, he just lies there, he’s different), and then even the stroking which has been given is withheld because “he doesn’t like to be held.” ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=891))
1
- There is a qualitative difference between the first three positions and the fourth position. The first three are unconscious, having been made early in life. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=936))
1
- The first three positions are based on feelings. The fourth is based on thought, faith, and the wager of action. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=946))
1
- Finally, it is essential to understand that I’M OK—YOU’RE OK is a position and not a feeling. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=977))
1
- The goal of Transactional Analysis is to enable a person to have freedom of choice, the freedom to change at will, to change the responses to recurring and new stimuli. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=1058))
1
- “creative causation.” ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=1132))
1
- suggesting that causes for human behavior lie not only in the past but in man’s ability to contemplate the future, or estimate probabilities: ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=1133))
1
- This brings us to the second rule of communication in Transactional Analysis. When stimulus and response cross on the P-A-C transactional diagram, communication stops. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0054KY9QW&location=1393))
