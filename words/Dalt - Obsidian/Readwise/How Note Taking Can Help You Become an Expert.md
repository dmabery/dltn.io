A - How Note Taking Can Help You Become an Expert

1
- Cognitive Flexibility Theory is a 30 year old learning theory that ends up someplace weird: it tells us that a *specific type of note taking* will help us learn better from history. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh6agqjn10yaejwcpkfreqqm))

- An ill-structured domain is a domain where there are concepts, but the way those concepts are instantiated in the real world are hugely variable, and messy as hell. As a result, most cases that practitioners deal with in an ill-structured domain will be novel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh6amgrh282pe9xy57bvwk1f))

- In other words: *why* should we study history, given that history doesn’t repeat itself, and in an ill-structured domain like business, all experiences I have will be novel? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7ngsc4y61fpwsdrdn9hnrb))

- “We want to win a position in the legal research market with analytics and, as lawyers turn to us for unique insights and easier user interfaces, we can expand our tools and content until we’re a complete alternative to the incumbents. Our technology scales efficiently, so we can also offer lower prices.” 
  Charlie spotted another pattern. “This reminds me of the ‘Cola Wars’ between Pepsi and Coke. Up until the Great Depression, Pepsi and Coke were priced the same and Coke was dominating the market. But then Pepsi cut their price per ounce by half and their sales took off, with profits doubling too. Price can be a powerful competitive tool when you have a good substitute product.” 
  Eventually, Charlie asked us for more detail about our funding plans. We told him about the round we were assembling and some of the other investors involved. 
  “I bet” he said, “that if I invested I could be a Judas goat for you.” 
  He noticed our confused looks.“You’re not familiar with a Judas goat?” 
  We shook our heads. 
  “A Judas goat is the goat that they lead from one pen to another, or the slaughterhouse, that all the other animals follow. I bet if I invested, you’d have a lot of other investors that would sign up too.” ([source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-we-learned-pitching-our-startup-charlie-munger-how-daniel-lewis/)) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7nn9ghvxtz3w96z0p24b5c))

    - Note: This is exactly what it looks like to learn from history. Anything more than this is over complicated and focuses to much on the act and not enough on the reading and mastering from history.
      This begs the question then, how do you put yourself in the situation to be able to 1. identify these broad lessons while you're reading (Price can be a good competitive tool when you have a good substitute product) and 2. recall those lessons, with enough of a story detail to also convince others in the room that your plan is best?

- What an adaptive worldview means is that whenever you learn a new concept in an ill-structured domain, you know *not* to oversimplify — that is, to represent it as a single principle or concept. *You do not try to reduce*. You instead know to search for new, different cases in order to collect a cluster of prototypes in your head, and let that cluster inform your understanding of the concept. If you encounter a new case, *you update the concept*, because the concept is only useful when you know how it is instantiated in reality.
