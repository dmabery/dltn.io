A - Lessons from Peter Thiel

1
- **2. Don’t divide your attention: focusing on one thing yields increasing returns for each unit of effort.**
  At a micro level, an extra hour of focus on the current project has a much higher return than an hour on something new, or worse, 5 minutes each on 12 new things. Before you ever do something new, you should understand the opportunity cost vs. existing things. Don’t rationalize that something you want to do is complementary when it’s not!
  At a macro level, understanding that applied effort has a convex output curve is a very useful discipline when considering new market areas. This convexity means that the opportunity cost of transferring resources from existing projects to new ones is high. Unless the new area is incredibly valuable, anything we can do to extend an existing convex curve is worth so much more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2hr0vwv52bpygmyzgysg1m4))

    - Note: When you have something that’s working, it’s almost always better to spend time making that thing work better, and not start something new.

- **3. In hiring, value intelligence highly. Like focus, intelligence yields increasing returns.**
  Like focus, intelligence has a convex output curve — the smartest people can be an order of magnitude more productive than others who are only somewhat less smart. The key in hiring is to value potential skill rather than currently existing skill — and potential skill is based on intelligence rather than training.

    - Note: Value potential skill, not current skill.

- **4. Obsess over perfection.**
  If you are designing something that a customer is going to use or that will represent us in public, it’s not good enough unless it’s flawless and extraordinary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2hr34wwrg4pymvjwmm0d7jm))

- If it’s 1am and you’ve already got something that is very good, this is why it’s worth spending the next couple of hours to make it amazing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2hr3p6t3w58j2y2zaxrncfc))

- **6. Don’t waste time talking about what you plan to think about; instead, work through it immediately.**
  Intellectual laziness can easily sneak up on you. If you are sitting there talking about problems you plan to solve later, there’s a good chance you are being inefficient. Similarly, in GTD, you don’t put off tasks that only take a couple minutes. In many cases, you can outline and solve or at least clarify any decision or problem you’re confronted with in just a few minutes.

- **8. Be skeptical of any sort of external allies, and don’t trust the execution of anyone outside Palantir.**
  In the abstract, this is because the incentives of the other company will not line up with ours, and even if they do for the moment, they no longer will once the situation changes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j2hrardgc2rzeda3yhdmg8nb))
