- Fast-forward a decade and a half, and I don’t think it’s a very controversial statement to say that Ezra Klein is one of the most important journalists in America. He founded Vox, one of the more important new digital content sites to come out in recent years ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1561000052/21520058))
