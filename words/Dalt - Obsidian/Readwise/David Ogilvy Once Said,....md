- David Ogilvy once said, “In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create.”
  If you want to sell, you better learn how to write.

1
- ✍🏼 Learn Who You're Writing For
  “The consumer isn't a moron. She is your wife." 
  Your copy should touch on:
  -Who you’re writing for
  -How that person thinks
  -What that person needs
  Let research shape your copy
  Let your voice fuel it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931367813488643))
1
- ✍🏼 Know The Product
  “Big ideas come from the unconscious...But your unconscious has to be well informed, or your idea will be irrelevant.”
  Learn every detail about the product/industry/audience before you write.
  Then unleash your unconscious mind and fuel the big ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931368681713666))

- ✍🏼 Nail the headline
  “On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.”
  Attention is essential.
  Start with a value-centric headline.
  Let everything follow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931369524707342))
1
- ✍🏼 Tell a Story
  “The worst fault a salesman can commit is to be a bore.”
  You hooked them in with your headline. Now it’s time to reel them in.
  Nothing can keep your audience more engaged than a well-formed story.
  Use the story to keep piquing the reader's interest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931370439110656))

- ✍🏼 Be Specific 
  "The more informative your advertising, the more persuasive it will be."
  Most people won't make decisions without being informed…
  The ones who are informed, act.
  Be specific to make sure you give them the confidence that acting is the right choice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931371353427974))
1
- ✍🏼Write For One
  Your ads may reach millions of people, but each person is alone with yours words.
  Don't write for the masses.
  Write for that one person.
  Ogilvy would pretend he was writing personal letters to the consumer.
  This would help him write more direct. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931372259409924))

- ✍🏼 Write Like You Talk
  Good copy feels like a conversation between two people.
  Don’t be the copywriter who writes useless jargon to look top-notch.
  Consumers can smell the BS.
  Write like you talk.
  Use a relaxed tone.
  This will result in easy reading and an engaged reader. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931373182189568))
1
- ✍🏼 Keep It Simple
  Fancy words that you can’t pronounce do nothing but confuse consumers.
  And confused consumers won’t convert.
  Good copy comes down to conveying your points briefly and with as few words as possible.
  The key is saying more with less. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375931374100738054))

- Here's a great example:
  When Ogilvy got the Rolls Royce account, he spent 3 weeks study the car. He wanted to know everything possible about it.
  When studying the car he found a line that ended up being his most famous headline he ever wrote. https://t.co/bjINBbe80x ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1375942707932172289))
