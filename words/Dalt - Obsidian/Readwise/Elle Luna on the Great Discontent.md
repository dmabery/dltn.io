A - Elle Luna on the Great Discontent

- Oh, I forgot to mention that I had a three week gig with [Uber](https://www.uber.com) before I joined the Mailbox team—this is where things get crazy! So I was using Uber all the time in San Francisco, even though I hated the design. And then I went to the Crunchies awards ceremony and at a post-ceremony event, where I was in a ball gown, I saw the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, sitting at the bar. I was three whiskeys deep at this point and I walked up to him and said, “I use Uber all the time and I absolutely hate the app. I think you should bring me in to fix it.” He replied, “Oh, yeah? What are the three things you’d fix about it?” I said, “I’d redo the logo, redo the entire app, and change the rating system.” I think there was something about being in a dress that empowered me to say such things. *(laughing)* And do you know what he said? He said, “Be at the Uber office at 9am on Monday.” I told him I couldn’t do it alone and he said he’d have a team for me.
  I thought the offer was bogus, but I went to Uber’s office on Monday at 9am, laughing to myself, and Travis led me back to a project room with two other designers—they were from outside of Uber and he had flown them in from New York! *That* is the magic of CEOs who get shit done. We took on the Uber app and redesigned it in three weeks. In fact, one of the guys he flew in from New York, Shalin Amin, ended up staying on full-time. The app is gorgeous and last night it won the *Fast Company* 2013 Innovation By Design Awards for the transportation category, beating out Mars Rover and Tesla ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6je2jxfg7d4mzcr11mj2my))
