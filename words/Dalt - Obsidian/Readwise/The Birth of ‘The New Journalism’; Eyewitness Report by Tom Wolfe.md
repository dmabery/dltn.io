A - The Birth of ‘The New Journalism’; Eyewitness Report by Tom Wolfe

- But there was this other lot of reporters as well … They tended to be what is known as “feature writers.” What they had in common was that they all regarded the newspaper as a motel you checked into overnight on the road to the final triumph. The idea was to get a job on a newspaper, keep body and soul together, pay the rent, get to know “the world,” accumulate “experience,” perhaps work some of the fat off your style—then, at some point, quit cold, say goodbye to journalism, move into a shack somewhere, work night and day for six months, and light up the sky with the final triumph. The final triumph was known as The Novel.

- Your Novel! At this late date—partly due to the New Journalism itself—it is hard to explain what an American dream the idea of writing a novel was in the 1940s, the 1950s, and right into the early 1960s. The Novel was no mere literary form. It was a psychological phenomenon. It was a cortical fever. It belonged in the glossary to *A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis*, somewhere between Narcissism and Obsessional Neuroses.

- The piece turned into a confession because first Krim admitted that the idea of being a novelist had been the overwhelming passion of his life, his spiritual calling, in fact, the Pacemaker that kept his ego ticking through all the miserable humiliations of his young manhood—then he faced up to the fact that he was now in his forties and had never written a novel and more than likely never would.

- In 1955, in *The Exurbanites*, the late A. C. Spectorsky depicted the well-paid Madison Avenue advertising genius as being a man who wouldn’t read a novel without checking out the dust jacket blurb and the picture of the author on the back … and if that ego-flushed little bastard with the unbuttoned shirt and the wind rushing through his locks was younger than he was, he couldn’t bear to open the goddamn book. Such was the grip of the damnable Novel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vbq5n6kdccf0b0w8ryh5c))

- The Novel seemed like one of the last of those super-strokes, like finding gold or striking oil, through which an American could, overnight, in a flash, utterly transform his destiny. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vd55fbttkpqqaccdcqfwn))

- There was no such thing as a *literary* journalist working for popular magazines or newspapers. If a journalist aspired to literary status—then he had better have the sense and the courage to quit the popular press and try to get into the big league.

- Portis did it in a way that was so much like the way it happens in the dream, it was unbelievable. One day he suddenly quit as London correspondent for the *Herald Tribune*. That was generally regarded as a very choice job in the newspaper business. Portis quit cold one day; just like that, without a warning. He returned to the United States and moved into a fishing shack in Arkansas. In six months he wrote a beautiful little novel called *Norwood*. Then he wrote *True Grit,* which was a best seller. The reviews were terrific … He sold both books to the movies … He made a fortune … A *fishing* shack! In *Arkansas*! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vg0y0dt1nt3ym5d5wwt57))

    - Note: this guy wrote true grit!! just like that.

- And yet in the early 1960s a curious new notion, just hot enough to inflame the ego, had begun to intrude into the tiny confines of the feature statusphere. It was in the nature of a discovery. This discovery, modest at first, humble, in fact, deferential, you might say, was that it just might be possible to write journalism that would … read like a novel. *Like* a novel, if you get the picture.

- They were dreamers, all right, but one thing they never dreamed of. They never dreamed of the approaching irony. They never guessed for a minute that the work they would do over the next ten years, as journalists, would wipe out the novel as literature’s main event.

- W*hat inna namea Christ is this*—in the fall of 1962 I happened to pick up a copy of *Esquire* and read a story called “Joe Louis: the King as a Middle-aged Man.” The piece didn’t open like an ordinary magazine article at all. It opened with the tone and mood of a short story, with a rather intimate scene; or intimate by the standards of magazine journalism in 1962, in any case: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vjk3v7pkfhje1qksncyh8))

- My instinctive, defensive reaction was that the man had piped it, as the saying went … winged it, made up the dialogue ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vqbqz9w3m8k8e6snc1rtq))

- Really stylish reporting was something no one knew how to deal with, since no one was used to thinking of reporting as having an *esthetic* dimension. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vpt0v3vrwx0pny5hqds8f))

- What he had written for *Esquire* was so much better than what he was doing (or was allowed to do) for the *Times*, I had to check out what was going on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vv0bb0n1dt6s30axzz07y))

- Newspaper columns had become a classic illustration of the theory that organizations tend to promote people up to their levels of incompetence. The usual practice was to give a man a column as a reward for outstanding service as a reporter. That way they could lose a good reporter and gain a bad writer. The archetypical newspaper columnist was Lippmann. For 35 years Lippmann seemed to do nothing more than ingest the *Times* every morning, turn it over in his ponderous cud for a few days, and then methodically egest it in the form of a drop of mush on the foreheads of several hundred thousand readers of other newspapers in the days thereafter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0vwy9tf85fyfs05b7r4wwd))

    - Note: "organizations promote people up to their level of incompetence..."
      so they do a good job, get promoted. do another good job, get promoted. do another good job, get promoted. until finally they stop doing a good job, they no longer get promoted.
      so the organization loses someone who was excelling and gets someone who isn't working.

- In any case, Breslin made a revolutionary discovery. He made the discovery that it was feasible for a columnist to leave the building, go outside and do reporting on his own, actual legwork. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0w4s0ez9bvk09hkrrspw2p))
1
- Breslin would go up to the city editor and ask what stories and assignments were coming up, choose one, go out, leave the building, cover the story as a reporter, and write about it in his column. If the story were big enough, his column would start on page one instead of inside. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0w51mq40yxqqw0fqwq73sr))

- Anytime you see a columnist trying to squeeze material out of his house, articles, books, or the television set, you’ve got a starving soul on your hands … You should send him a basket . . . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0w6g6m5k97e1p858t1st8b))

- Well—all right! Say what you will! There it was, a short story, complete with symbolism, in fact, and yet true-life, as they say, about something that happened today, and you could pick it up on the newsstand by 11 tonight for a dime . . . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wafk8n26k48raaeekvnth))
1
- Breslin’s work stirred up a certain vague resentment among both journalists and literati during the first year or two of his column—vague, because they never fully understood what he was doing … only that in some vile Low Rent way the man’s output was *literary*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wavwyx8c1gevb3z7g8bgb))
1
- Breslin made it a practice to arrive on the scene long before the main event in order to gather the off-camera material, the byplay in the make-up room, that would enable him to create character. It was part of his *modus operandi* to gather “novelistic” details, the rings, the perspiration, the jabs on the shoulder, and he did it more skillfully than most novelists. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wjb8v6b42f8579ky27a2a))
1
- The idea is: Given such-and-such a body of material, what has the artist done with it? The crucial part that reporting plays in all story-telling, whether in novels, films, or non-fiction, is something that is not so much ignored as simply not comprehended. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wjxv1vhqgrfn325t3jhne))
1
- I wasn’t thinking about that at all. It is hard to say what it was like. It was a garage sale, that piece … vignettes, odds and ends of scholarship, bits of memoirs, short bursts of sociology, apostrophes, epithets, moans, cackles, anything that came into my head, much of it thrown together in a rough and awkward way. Its virtue was precisely in showing me the possibility of there being something “new” in journalism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wn4xv8s63mwg8gx7m89vv))
1
- What interested me was not simply the discovery that it was possible to write accurate non-fiction with techniques usually associated with novels and short stories. It was that—plus. It was the discovery that it was possible in non-fiction, in journalism, to use any literary device, from the traditional dialogisms of the essay to stream-of-consciousness, and to use many different kinds simultaneously, or within a relatively short space … to excite the reader both intellectually and emotionally.

    - Note: cool way to say "that is fun, but worthless."
1
- I never felt the slightest hesitation about trying any device that might conceivably grab the reader a few seconds longer. I tried to yell right in his ear: *Stick around*! … Sunday supplements were no place for diffident souls. That was how I started playing around with the device of point-of-view. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wvacwknmjax5ec7gz7rkw))
1
- Then I started in again, and so on. There was nothing subtle about such a device, which might be called the Hectoring Narrator. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wx3sr894w3vxpnve6ws06))
1
- I liked the idea of starting off a story by letting the reader, via the narrator, talk to the characters, hector them, insult them, prod them with irony or condescension, or whatever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wxc90k63r0s6dt0hxy7hv))

- Why should the reader be expected to just lie flat and let these people come tromping through as if his mind were a subway turnstile? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wxjxy2wzgyqs5fs93kggh))
1
- Once you know about it, you start seeing it. All the time!”… and so on … anything to avoid coming on like the usual non-fiction narrator, with a hush in my voice, like a radio announcer at a tennis match. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wyyybgeznxjv824gvkbzg))
1
- The voice of the narrator, in fact, was one of the great problems in non-fiction writing. Most non-fiction writers, without knowing it, wrote in a century-old British tradition in which it was understood that the narrator shall assume a calm, cultivated and, in fact, genteel voice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0wz8va3e2qgkrdwdq8zvx0))

- The standard non-fiction writer’s voice was like the standard announcer’s voice … a drag, a droning . . . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0x0k911qxt7vy92ksq4030))

- Now, as long as Junior Johnson was explaining the corn liquor industry, there was no problem, because (a) dialogue tends to be naturally attractive, or involving, to the reader; and (b) Johnson’s Ingle Hollow lingo was unusual. But then I had to take over the explanation myself, in order to compress into a few paragraphs information that had come from several interviews. So … I decided I would rather talk in Ingle Hollow accents myself, since that seemed to go over all right. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0x1yeeygr1gbhex66me3n7))
1
- I was feigning the tones of an Ingle Hollow moonshiner, in order to create the illusion of seeing the action through the eyes of someone who was actually on the scene and involved in it, rather than a beige narrator. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0x3csx2t5xz60d9cc2h6y5))
1
- I began to think of this device as the *downstage voice*, as if characters downstage from the protagonist himself were talking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0x6cwdq7yhrbp8tsbph9ge))

- “Bangs manes bouffant beehives Beatle caps butter faces brush-on lashes decal eyes puffy sweaters French thrust bras flailing leather blue jeans stretch pants stretch jeans honeydew bottoms eclair shanks elf boots ballerinas Knight slippers, hundreds of them, these flaming little buds, bobbing and screaming, rocketing around inside the Academy of Music Theater underneath that vast old moldering cherub dome up there—aren’t they super-marvelous!
  “‘Aren’t they super-marvelous!’ says Baby Jane, and then: ‘Hi, Isabel! Isabel! You want to sit backstage—with the Stones!’
  “The show hasn’t even started yet, the Rolling Stones aren’t even on the stage, the place is full of a great shabby moldering dimness, and these flaming little buds.
  “Girls are reeling this way and that way in the aisle and through their huge black decal eyes, sagging with Tiger Tongue Lick Me brush-on eyelashes and black appliqués, sagging like display-window Christmas trees, they keep staring at—her—Baby Jane—on the aisle.”
  > “… A reviewer called me a ‘chameleon.’ He meant it negatively. I took it as a compliment. A chameleon … but precisely! …”
  As you see, the opening paragraph is a rush of Groovy clothes ending with the phrase “—aren’t they super-marvelous!” With this phrase I shifted into the point-of-view of Baby Jane, looking through her eyes at the young girls, “the flaming little buds,” who are running around the theater. The description continues through Jane’s eyes until the phrase “they keep staring at—her—Baby Jane,” whereupon the point-of-view shifts to the young girls, and the reader is suddenly looking through *their* eyes at Baby Jane: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0x8gqkjn3cnmfn7pyy2s29))

- Later I read the English critic John Bayley’s yearnings for an age when writers had Pushkin’s sense of “looking at all things afresh,” as if for the first time, without the constant intimidation of being aware of what other writers have already done.

- We developed the habit of staying with the people we were writing about for days at a time, weeks in some cases. We had to gather all the material the conventional journalist was after—and then keep going. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0xs3bh9tkksfn8w2s5h7aa))

- I have no idea who coined the term the New Journalism or when it was coined. I have never even liked the term. Any movement, group, party, program, philosophy or theory that goes under a name with “new” in it is just begging for trouble, of course.

- I found a great many pieces of punctuation and typography lying around dormant when I came along—and I must say I had a good time using them. I figured it was time someone violated what Orwell called “the Geneva conventions of the mind” … a protocol that had kept journalism and non-fiction generally (and novels) in such a tedious bind for so long. I found that things like exclamation points, italics, and abrupt shifts (dashes) and syncopations (dots) helped to give the illusion not only of a person talking but of a person thinking. I used to enjoy using dots where they would be least expected, not at the end of a sentence but in the middle, creating the effect … of a skipped beat. It seemed to me the mind reacted—*first*! … in dots, dashes, and exclamation points, then rationalized, drew up a brief, with periods.

- 1966, *Atlantic* by Dan Wakefield, entitled “The Personal Voice and the Impersonal Eye.” The gist of this piece was that for the first time in anybody’s memory, for the first time since the turn of the century when the occasional Nobel Prize was thrown to writers like Theodor Mommsen, people in the literary world were beginning to talk about non-fiction as a serious artistic form.
