B - Man's Search for Meaning

- “He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.” ([Location 21](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=21))

- But Frankl’s concern is less with the question of why most died than it is with the question of why anyone at all survived. ([Location 25](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=25))

- Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.

- Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you. ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=34))

- Frankl would have argued that we are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose how we will respond. ([Location 40](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=40))
1
- if hundreds of thousands of people reach out for a book whose very title promises to deal with the question of a meaning to life, it must be a question that burns under their fingernails. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=65))

- “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=79))

- Then you will live to see that in the long run—in the long run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.” ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=83))

- I think it was Lessing who once said, “There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.” ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=305))
1
- The truth—that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=519))
1
- The salvation of man is through love and in love. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=520))
1
- Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=532))
1
- This intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find a refuge from the emptiness, desolation and spiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=538))

- To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=601))
1
- No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=645))
1
- may give the impression that the human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=851))
1
- everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=862))
1
- the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=868))
1
- If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=878))
1
- The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=880))
1
- It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=882))
1
- man’s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=887))

- With the end of uncertainty there came the uncertainty of the end. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=915))

- It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future—sub specie aeternitatis ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=948))

- What does Spinoza say in his Ethics? —“Affectus, qui passio est, desinit esse passio simulatque eius claram et distinctam formamus ideam.” Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=961))
1
- Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man—his courage and hope, or lack of them—and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=981))

- “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=992))
1
- we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=997))

- Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1000))
1
- When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1008))
1
- But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer. Only ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1020))
1
- In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1028))
1
- man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1034))
