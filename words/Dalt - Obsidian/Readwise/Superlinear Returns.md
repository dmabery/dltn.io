A - Superlinear Returns

1
- If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvfsjvd9b05e34ymhzsmjs7))

- The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression "winner take all." In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better.

- Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.

- Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvg1x9ggvpts1kdthrtz6ts))

- Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvg2nmd6zfw92nqmtgery98))

- But don't overoptimize *what* you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.

- A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one.

- promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem *isn't* likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvg5f7x00040qz5005tk9nb))

- Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out.

- The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvg8vmt91z50ytqtj9mjh3f))
1
- There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvg9p4cf3264ekpbymbaejk))

- Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

- And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvgbgs7pcz4s6026s5z8hzj))

- This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvgcdtxrzdggn4gkq3j9n3z))

- But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be [independent-minded](http://paulgraham.com/think.html) to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well. [[12](http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f12n)]
  This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvge5sfebh3d1cyzce45q3p))

- What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first. *At this rate,* you find yourself thinking, *I'll never get anywhere.* But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvgem6766bmn7ph1hswwvqm))
1
- It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdvgg25vj7rcb6aqxckh8bzr))
1
- The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.
