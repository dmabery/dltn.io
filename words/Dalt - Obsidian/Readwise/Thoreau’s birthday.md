A - Thoreau’s birthday

1
- One of his mentors, [Walter Jackson Bate](https://www.amazon.com/Splendor-Heart-Jackson-Teaching-Literature/dp/1567924751), taught him his [100 chapters of 5 pages each](http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/66144-1/Robert-D-Richardson-Jr) method of composition:
  > I had a wonderful teacher at Harvard, W.J. Bate, who wrote very great biographies of Keats and then of Johnson, and his advice to me when he discovered that I was daring to write a biography was to write in short takes; if at all possible, to write in short pieces so that the reader feels that he or she is getting somewhere. I mean, that’s a big, heavy book. And people have busy lives and they have lots else to do, and if you can sit down and read four or five pages and feel like you’re getting somewhere instead of these big 30 or 40-page or 50-page chapters, it makes a book readable that might not otherwise seem so.
