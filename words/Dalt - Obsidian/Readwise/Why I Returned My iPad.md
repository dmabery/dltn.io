- I did my email on it, of course. But I also wrote articles using Pages. I watched episodes of *Weeds* on Netflix. I checked the news, the weather, and the traffic. And, of course, I proudly showed it to, well, anyone who indicated the least bit of interest. (That could be a whole post in itself. We proudly show off new purchases as though simply possessing them is some form of accomplishment. Why? I didn’t create the iPad. I just bought one.)
  It didn’t take long for me to encounter the dark side of this revolutionary device: it’s too good.

- So why is this a problem? It sounds like I was super-productive. Every extra minute, I was either producing or consuming.
  But something — more than just sleep, though that’s critical too — is lost in the busyness. Something too valuable to lose.
  Boredom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3n2zkxxq8rxzg0ga6ja0sgm))

- Being bored is a precious thing, a state of mind we should pursue. Once boredom sets in, our minds begin to wander, looking for something exciting, something interesting to land on. And that’s where creativity arises. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3n2ztqnr6btcf66bcg69dhp))

- My best ideas come to me when I am *un*productive. When I am running but not listening to my iPod. When I am sitting, doing nothing, waiting for someone.
