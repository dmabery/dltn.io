A - On Writing Better: Getting Started

1
- Good writing flashes between the concrete and the abstract, the particular and the general; it uses specific details and images to ignite our feelings and open our minds to the wider world. It treats words as if they have just come into the world for the first time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4y8847yp6dxst9hrrvmsmw))
1
- You have to want to tell people what you feel, what you care about, what you believe, what you know; if you don’t have something you’re on fire to tell us about, you shouldn’t be writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4y9fa52zxt18ch3mcja7yw))
1
- So it’s okay to drop a piece of writing when you can’t seem to make headway on it. Use the extra time you’ve just created to write something else instead, so you can still work on polishing your craft even when you aren’t working on the piece of writing you most want to do. Writer’s block doesn’t mean you can’t write anything*;* it just means you can’t write the one thing you’ve been working on.

- **First**, ask yourself: What is the single most basic fact about my topic? By “basic,” I mean the simplest possible observation or evidence you can think of. It might be the name of someone you want to mention in what you write; which day of the week something happened; where you were when you learned the lesson you don’t yet have the words to describe; a saying you love; a color or sound or smell or taste or touch that reminds you of what you wish you could tell us about.

1
- Notice what you’ve just done. Your screen or page isn’t blank anymore*.* Now, it says “June 13, 2016.” Or “Lucy Aldobelli.” Or “green.” Or whatever.
  *You’ve just written something!*
  **Now keep going.** What happened on June 13, 2016? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4ye44z1z30dv1b7kvyydy7))
1
- **Next, if you get stuck again,** say these words out loud…
  “I want you to know about all this because”
  …and then finish speaking the rest of that sentence as fast as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4yfc08n78fw637jha9mp4x))
1
- Now answer the natural corollary questions: Exactly why does this matter to anybody else? How can I best show people why it’s important? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4yfp8rmp2nr99mfhbpmhp0))
1
- One more trick: If you’re writing something long and making good progress, but you won’t have time to finish it until tomorrow, stop in midstream. You can even stop in the middle of a sentence. Go do any old thing that gets your mind off your writing. Pick it up the next day; it will be easier to resume where you left off if you stopped right in the middle of a great idea that you know how to see through to completion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4yh77hmgh98bsf4gs8x0vd))
1
- To get away with talking about yourself, you must either be extraordinarily brilliant or willing to ridicule yourself — or both. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4yk92wjz02p5hg1rzew931))

- I took a similar approach in **[one of the most deadly-serious columns I’ve ever written](http://jasonzweig.com/from-the-archives-baloney-com/)**. In 1999, I was desperately trying to discourage investors from turning into speculators in the reckless market for dot-com stocks. The column was (I still think today) rooted in logic, statistical evidence, and centuries of financial history. But I knew no one would read it unless I acknowledged how absurd I sounded preaching prudence even as the inmates were taking over the asylum. So I began with this sentence:
  > For the next few months, perhaps even for a year or two, this may seem like one of the stupidest investing columns ever written. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4ynm7fmfseexwx116qhrjx))

- I believe in a powerful paradox: By stepping far enough outside yourself to take a stance of ironic distance, you can draw readers closer to what you’re saying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4yp5qkqeq4vpgcf96qh139))
1
- Instead of trying to sound distinctive, just sound like you. Your style is yourself; how you write is who you are. Appealing to someone who’s never read you before is exactly like going out on a first date: The worst thing you can possibly do is to pretend to be someone other than yourself.

- My dad used to say, “If you try to make an impression, that’s the impression you’ll make.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4ypxcfan222vjtr4rggnpq))
1
- I know who I am, so my readers will always know, too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4yrhff5twvqdhv6x02y5ap))
1
- If you want to become a better writer, the two biggest things you can do are to write more and read more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4ys99vmtfsqs57xchqf4a6))
1
- By “writing more,” I mean always writing mindfully — developing good mental hygiene by never being sloppy or lazy, whether you’re tossing off an email, putting together an office memo, or writing a note inside a birthday card. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4yshgnkz9pw7xhw3z23mct))
1
- Every blank screen or empty piece of paper, no matter what its purpose, offers a new possibility to try being fresh and original. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw4ysx33hbq5srjcmkxqpc1f))
