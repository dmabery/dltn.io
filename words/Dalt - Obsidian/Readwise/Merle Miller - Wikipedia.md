  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  American novelist
  **Merle Dale Miller**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-1) (May 17, 1919 – June 10, 1986) was an American writer, novelist, and author who is perhaps best remembered for his best-selling biography of [Harry S. Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman), and as a pioneer in the .
  Miller [came out of the closet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Came_out_of_the_closet) in an article in the *New York Times Magazine* on January 17, 1971, "What It Means to Be a Homosexual." The response of over 2,000 letters to the article, more than ever received by that newspaper, led to a book publication later that year. The book was reprinted by Penguin Classics in 2012, with a new foreword by [Dan Savage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Savage) and a new afterword by [Charles Kaiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kaiser).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-3)
  Life and career[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Merle_Miller&action=edit&section=1)]
  Merle Miller was born in [Montour, Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montour,_Iowa), and raised in [Marshalltown, Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalltown,_Iowa), attending the University of Iowa and the London School of Economics. Before World War II, he was a Washington correspondent for the late Philadelphia Record. During the war, Miller served both in the Pacific and in Europe as a war correspondent and editor for *[Yank, The Army Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yank,_The_Army_Weekly)*.
  Following his discharge from the Army, he was an editor at *Harper* and *Time* magazines. He also worked as a book reviewer for *The Saturday Review of Literature* and as a contributing editor for *The Nation*. His work appeared frequently in the *New York Times Magazine*.
  His works of non-fiction include *We Dropped the A-Bomb* (1946), a book he wrote in collaboration with Abe Spitzer, a radioman who was on the bomber [The Great Artiste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Artiste), one of the three B-29s that participated in the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; *The Judges and The Judged* (1952); *Only You Dick Daring* (1964), Miller's scathing account of trying to make a show with CBS for the 1963-1964 television season; and *On Being Different: What It Means To Be a Homosexual* (1971). Miller was a contributor to *A Treasury of Great Reporting*; ""The Best of Yank*; and* Yank: The GI Story of the War*.*
  In 1967 he signed the "[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_and_Editors_War_Tax_Protest)," vowing to refuse to pay taxes raised to fund the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-5)
  Miller wrote many television plays and was the author of the screenplays, "The Rains of Ranchiphur" (1955), which starred [Richard Burton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton) and [Lana Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Turner), and "Kings Go Forth," (1958), featuring [Frank Sinatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra) and [Natalie Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood). He wrote several drafts of a screenplay for "A Walk on the Wild Side," but by the time the screen version was being shot it was so far removed from what he had written or had in mind that he refused any screen credit.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-6) His postwar career as a television script writer and novelist was interrupted by the advent of [Senator Joseph McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Joseph_McCarthy) and Miller's inclusion on the [Hollywood blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist). He did not re-enter TV until the late 1950s and early 60s.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-Sex-7)
  After the success of *Plain Speaking* Miller wrote two more biographies, *Lyndon, A Biography of President Lyndon Baines Johnson*, and *Ike the Soldier*, a biography of General Dwight David Eisenhower. He had completed all the interviews and research with the intention of writing a second volume, to be titled *Ike the President*, but died just after finishing the first volume Ike the Soldier.
  Miller died on June 10, 1986, in Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, from peritonitis following surgery to remove a ruptured appendix.
  Merle Miller Special Collections containing all of his taped interviews, research material, notes and correspondence are housed at three presidential libraries in Missouri, Texas and Kansas, as well as the University of Iowa and Boston University. They are all open and available to the public.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-8)
  *Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman*[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Merle_Miller&action=edit&section=2)]
  In 1962, Miller was hired by producer [Robert Alan Aurthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Alan_Aurthur) as part of a team to interview and write the script for a proposed series on ex-President [Harry Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Truman). He spent hundreds of hours with Truman both at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, and at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City, but all three of the major networks were not interested in the series and turned it down. Miller felt that perhaps the time was not right, that many people were not aware of the greatness of the man, and that it was possible that the country was not ready to look back at the Truman years. He also felt one of the reasons ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j29ws4kdytdjfzh2fgqwr01n))

- *Plain Speaking* is a book based on conversations between Miller and the 33rd president of the United States, as well as others who knew Truman over the years. Robert A. Aurthur said, "No one will ever study or write about the time of Truman again without a bow of gratitude to Merle Miller. Never has a President of the United States, or any head of state for that matter, been so totally revealed, so completely documented...."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-10)
  In October 1974, on a stop in [Independence, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence,_Missouri), promoting the book, Miller was presented the key to the city by Mayor Richard King, who stated: "You captured the spirit of Harry S. Truman, and President Truman represents the spirit of Independence."[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Miller#cite_note-11) While there Miller was interviewed by the editor of a local newspaper and asked if he had received any serious criticism of his treatment of the Truman tapes. "Only minor criticism," Miller replied. "One of the controversial points was Mr. Truman's interpretation of the meeting with MacArthur at Wake Island. I'm satisfied that the account Mr. Truman gave me is correct." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j29wtk19snnky4qg6wb9dba1))
