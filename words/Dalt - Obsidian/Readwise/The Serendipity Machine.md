- **Tweet for the kinds of followers you want.** Over time you build up a sense of what kinds of tweets 'do well' and what doesn't. Be suspicious of this! It's fine to tweet for engagement occasionally, but I suggest taking the 'journal' idea seriously and tweeting for the kinds of followers you want. In practice, you'll find that viral tweets don't get you high-quality followers anyway. The real “game” is meeting the kind of people you’ll get along with and making friends with them; tweet the kinds of thoughts that attract *those* people, which are usually not the type of tweets that go viral.

- **Do cool shit first, then tweet about it as ‘exhaust’; not the other way round.** Some people become "Twitter personalities" and I think this is a trap. By this I mean: they live on Twitter first and foremost, and spend most of their time tweeting, but they don't do interesting things in real life. The best ordering is the reverse: do interesting and valuable things, or learn interesting things, and then tweet about them. Think of the tweets as exhaust from the interesting things you do; don't think of tweets as the primary product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmqht8acpwayt4813pz0pykz))

- A simple example: many of my favorite accounts read a lot of books or papers, and just tweet out interesting paragraphs or summaries or things they learned. This is a great way to use Twitter: tweet screenshots of books you’re reading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmqhtfpe7pcq2qqya1h3wt3g))
