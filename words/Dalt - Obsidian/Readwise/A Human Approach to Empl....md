- In 10 years at Bridgewater, I regularly gave feedback most would consider harsh.
  Doing that well takes trust and care.
  Sadly, leaders often give feedback that does more harm than good.
  That doesnâ€™t have to be you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521061573611522))
1
- 1/ Why give feedback? 
  To inspire the change needed to improve the outcome.
  - The goal is NOT to get people to conform. 
  - The goal is NOT to get things off your chest. 
  - The goal is NOT to force them do it your way.
  If outcomes don't improve, your feedback didn't work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521062647353344))

- 2/ How do you inspire change?
  If you have ever been inspired by someone to grow, you know the formula:
  GROWTH = TRUST + CLARITY + PRACTICALITY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521063737950209))
1
- Trust -> You truly believe they have your best interests in mind
  Clarity -> You understand the feedback in your terms, not theirs
  Practicality -> You can take immediate, corrective action ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521064778133505))
1
- 3/ How do I build trust? 
  - Be vulnerable with your own faults; normalize weaknesses since we all have them
  - Set clear expectations upfront - your version of success and their version should be reconciled early
  - Relentlessly highlight and praise what people do well ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521065830834189))
1
- Why focus on positives? 
  First, it addresses your negative skew as a manager. And human:
  "The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences, but Teflon for positive ones" - Rick Hansen 
  Second, we grow bigger & faster from our strengths than our weaknesses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521066837528578))
1
- Shouldn't my team want feedback? 
  Leaders like @RayDalio & @simonsinek both attribute their success to craving negative feedback. 
  The key part of that sentence: they crave it. 
  Gamechanger if your team comes to crave it, but unlikely that's your starting point.
  Start slow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521067898626051))
1
- 4/ Set expectations upfront
  Biggest mistake I see managers making?
  Not investing in a shared understanding of what good looks like.
  And it's not just goals.
  It's a picture of HOW those goals get accomplished.
  Done well, feedback is just a comparison to that shared picture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521069173817348))
1
- 5/ Making feedback clear
  Positive or negative, now you need to communicate clearly.
  Start with what which conversation you're having.
  I like @joulee's framework:
  Task -> specific execution
  Behavior -> emerging patterns
  Performance -> overall trajectory vs expectations ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521070436175872))
1
- 6/ What's the right mix?
  Positive vs Negative -> 3:1
  Type:
  - Task -> Daily but no less than weekly
  - Behavior -> Cover in a 1:1 mtg 1x/month
  - Performance -> No less than 2x no more than 4x/year
  Tip: Frequent minor feedback relieves pressure, preventing explosive buildups. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521071484801024))
1
- 7/ What's the right forum?
  As a leader, you need to build a picture of your people.
  And know what gets the most from them.
  - Modest? Praise in private.
  - Need time to digest? Send an email.
  - Stubborn? Have trusted others weigh in.
  - Entrenched? Work through it with the team. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521072642428929))
1
- 8/ Messaging matters
  - No kitchen sink. We can only process so much.
  - Be specific with relevant examples.
  - Use Feeling, Behavior, Impact from @KristenHadeed
  "I felt <feeling> when you <behavior>. The <impact>."
  - Don't dictate how they correct. Do confirm that they agree. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521073766518786))
1
- 9/ Feedback on feedback
  How can you figure out if it resonates? 
  Ask:
  - Does this match you picture / make sense to you?
  - What is your path forward / next steps?
  Watch out for: caveats, "buts" and detail obsession
  Reset back to the expectations you set upfront if need be. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521074894794753))
1
- 10/ Two underutilized tactics:
  Start with a question.
  - "How do you think the presentation went?"
  - "What is the key message you think came through in your memo?"
  They usually know. 
  And it helpfully flips the dynamic -> They critique, you coach. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521076048220166))
1
- Ask why?
  Hidden behind suboptimal performance is a misalignment:
  - values
  - motivations
  - expectations
  - understanding
  "Why" will surface the highest leverage disagreement.

- 13/ Feedback myths
  Sandwich feedback between compliments
  - Most condescending advice ever.
  - Be direct. These are pros, treat them as such.
  Problems & excellence are on a continuum
  - Solving problems restores order.
  - Excellence emerges from strength. 
  - Positive >> Critical. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dklineii/status/1480521080838123520))

- 14/ Not a manager?
  These same tactics work for being a good teammate.
  Or perhaps you're thinking about your boss.
  We have a question in our house: Helpful or hurtful? 
  If your boss is too often the latter:

- 15/ Final thoughts
  Feedback is a gift.
  Ironically, it's best received by those with a clear picture of themselves.

- But here's a secret: 
  Acknowledge and deal with your weaknesses. 
  That way, no one can use them against you.

- Want to go deeper?
  60% of new mangers fail in the 1st 18 months.
  Why?
  They don't get trained in the tactics they need to thrive.
  Feedback & Development is just one module we're going deep on in my New Manager Accelerator course.
