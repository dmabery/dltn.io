T - There Are Two Things I O...

1
- There are two things I optimize for when running @morningbrew social
  1) building a community and 2) growth
  here's a thread on how I approach community building
  growth later
1
- 1/ The coffee mug emoji
  This is by far MB‚Äôs most powerful community signal
  If a picture speaks a thousands words, this emoji speaks a thousand characters
  ‚òïÔ∏è IS Morning Brew at this point
  It conveys you read, work at, or love the Brew, all without saying a word
1
- 2/ Consistent responses
  MB gets nearly 10,000 mentions every month so it's hard to respond to everybody
  but you have to in order to build brand affinity 
  so I created a consistent reply i could reuse
  you compliment the Brew, you get a ü§ù‚òïÔ∏è
  @fridaybeers was my inspo for this https://t.co/OATbW7SBb8
1
- 3/ Building in public
  BIP has turned into a bit of a buzzword at this point, but it‚Äôs still extremely effective
  this thread you're currently reading is an example
  after, I hope you feel closer to the Brew and more a part of our community
1
- 4/ Recurring jokes
  my goal for certain tweets is to make people feel like the DiCaprio-pointing-at-the-screen meme when they see a joke on our account
  these "technical analysis" tweets are a great example
  doing it one time = funny
  doing it multiple times = community builder https://t.co/KrraZjX6Cq
1
- 5/ Breaking the 4th wall
  I rarely tweet in 1st person from the Brew account
  but because of my personal account, people know it's me
  knowing it's me WITHOUT us outright telling them, lets people feel closer to the brand (because humans > brands) https://t.co/gxl5EkJ5Jw
1
- 6/ Access to leadership
  this goes hand in hand with building in public
  you can't beat the community building @businessbarista and @austin_rief manufacture as they describe their view from the highest rungs of the company https://t.co/p8t0jOfPmK
1
- 7/ Follower pushes
  The #MorningBrewTo100k was a great community moment
  Austin had the idea of ‚Äúputting Toby‚Äôs job on the line‚Äù
  Inside joke ‚úîÔ∏è
  Breaking the 4th wall ‚úîÔ∏è
  Cause to rally behind ‚úîÔ∏è https://t.co/YglCXTIqWp
1
- 8/ Showing up in the right places
  during the GameStop saga, I sent 4x as many tweets as usual over those three days because ppl expected us to be part of the convo
  by showing up where we're supposed to, we build trust
  by building trust, we build community https://t.co/UMGqTmWHSm
1
- 9/ Lead with value
  pithy tweets are great, but being a brand that gives followers value is always the best way to accumulate trust & build a community
  we'll definitely be doubling down on explainer threads like this going forward

1
- 10/ Sound like a human
  brand speak is dead
  long live tweeting like a human
  you want to build a community of people around your brand? 
  speak to them like a person
