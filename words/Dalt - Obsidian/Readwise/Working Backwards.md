B - Working Backwards

1
- “We have an unshakeable conviction that the long-term interests of shareowners are perfectly aligned with the interests of customers.”2 In other words, while it’s true that shareholder value stems from growth in profit, Amazon believes that long-term growth is best produced by putting the customer first. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=44))
1
- “Our culture is four things: customer obsession instead of competitor obsession; willingness to think long term, with a longer investment horizon than most of our peers; eagerness to invent, which of course goes hand in hand with failure; and then, finally, taking professional pride in operational excellence.” ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=48))
1
- Bar Raiser hiring process that ensures that the company continues to acquire top talent; a bias for separable teams run by leaders with a singular focus that optimizes for speed of delivery and innovation; the use of written narratives instead of slide decks to ensure that deep understanding of complex issues drives well-informed decisions; a relentless focus on input metrics to ensure that teams work on activities that propel the business. And finally there is the product development process that gives this book its name: working backwards from the desired customer experience. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=61))
1
- “We need to plant many seeds,” he would say, “because we don’t know which one of those seeds will grow into a mighty oak.” It was an apt analogy. The oak is one of the sturdiest and longest-living trees in the forest. Each tree produces thousands of acorns for every one tree that eventually rises to the sky. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=129))
1
- “When I interview people I tell them, ‘You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three.’” ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=269))
1
- His standards could be maintained only if the company itself, from top to bottom, somehow committed to keeping them at the forefront. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=282))
1
- If, for example, a person spoke up at a meeting and suggested an idea that was obviously geared toward short-term considerations and ignored significant longer-term ones, or proposed something that was competitor- rather than customer-centric, there would be an uncomfortable pause before someone pointed out what was on everyone else’s mind. While this practice may not be unique to Amazon, it is a defining element of its success. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=292))
1
- In the 2015 shareholder letter, Jeff wrote, “You can write down your corporate culture, but when you do so, you’re discovering it, uncovering it—not creating it.” ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=303))
1
- “Leaders do not believe their body odor smells of perfume” ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=318))
1
- “Unless you know better ones.” This reminds people to always seek to improve the status quo. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=328))
1
- if a company’s principles must be memorized, it’s a warning sign that they aren’t sufficiently woven into the fabric of that company. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=336))
1
- Amazon’s Leadership Principles6 Customer Obsession. Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=347))
1
- Ownership. Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=351))
1
- Invent and Simplify. Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=353))
1
- Are Right, A Lot. Leaders are right a lot. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=357))
1
- Learn and Be Curious. Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=358))
1
- Hire and Develop the Best. Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=359))
1
- Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=361))
1
- Insist on the Highest Standards. Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=362))
1
- Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=364))
1
- Think Big. Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=365))
1
- Bias for Action. Speed matters in business. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=367))
1
- Frugality. Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=369))
1
- Earn Trust. Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=371))
1
- Dive Deep. Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=373))
1
- Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit. Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=375))
1
- Deliver Results. Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=378))
1
- The Door Desk Award goes to a person who exemplifies Frugality and Invention. The Just Do It Award is an abnormally large, well-worn Nike sneaker given to employees who exhibit a Bias for Action. It usually goes to a person who has come up with a clever idea outside the scope of their job. What’s peculiarly Amazonian about the award is that the idea doesn’t have to be implemented—nor does it have to actually work if it is—in order to be eligible. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=384))

1
- Amazon realized early on that if you don’t change the underlying condition that created a problem, you should expect the problem to recur. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=395))
1
- S-Team goals are mainly input-focused metrics that measure the specific activities teams need to perform during the year that, if achieved, will yield the desired business results. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=436))
1
- At many companies, when the senior leadership meets, they tend to focus more on big-picture, high-level strategy issues than on execution. At Amazon, it’s the opposite. Amazon leaders toil over the execution details and regularly embody the Dive Deep leadership principle, which states: “Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.” ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=446))
1
- The OP planning process aligns the entire company on what’s truly important to accomplish for the year. S-Team goals refine that alignment by giving top priority to the company’s biggest or most pressing objectives. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=453))
1
- Money talks—if your leadership principles, your yearly plan, and your financial incentives are not closely aligned, you won’t get the right results. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=464))
1
- The wrong kind of compensation practice can cause misalignment in two ways: (1) by rewarding short-term goals at the expense of long-term value creation, and (2) by rewarding the achievement of localized departmental milestones whether or not they benefit the company as a whole. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=470))
1
- As one is promoted at Amazon, the ratio of cash to equity compensation becomes more and more skewed toward long-term equity. The Frugality leadership principle makes the reason very plain: “There are no extra points for headcount, budget size, or expense.” ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=484))
1
- Adding, subtracting, and modifying your principles in response to change or deeper understanding is a sign that you’re probably doing things right. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=498))
1
- Jeff often said in those days, “We want missionaries, not mercenaries.” We have all encountered mercenaries in our career. They are in it to make a fast buck for themselves, they don’t have the organization’s best interests at heart, and they don’t have the resolve to stick with your company through challenging times. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=517))
1
- Organizational culture comes about in one of two ways. It’s either decisively defined, nurtured and protected from the inception of the organization; or—more typically—it comes about haphazardly as a collective sum of the beliefs, experiences and behaviors of those on the team. Either way, you will have a culture. For better or worse.”2 ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=635))
1
- The hiring manager should not bring a candidate in for the time-consuming and expensive interview loop unless they are inclined to hire them after the phone interview. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=753))
1
- This involves assigning one or more of the 14 Leadership Principles to each member of the interview panel, who in turn poses questions that map to their assigned leadership principle, seeking to elicit two kinds of data. First, the interviewer wants the candidate to provide detailed examples of what they personally contributed to solving hard problems or how they performed in work situations like the ones they will experience at Amazon. Second, the interviewer wants to learn how the candidate accomplished their goals and whether their methods align with the Amazon Leadership Principles. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=788))
1
- As noted in the Green Corp. example earlier, written feedback is essential to an effective hiring process, and this means that every interviewer must take detailed notes—as close to a verbatim record as possible. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=839))
1
- Another method for the Bar Raiser to help get the meeting started is to create a two-column list on a whiteboard of the Leadership Principles where the candidate meets the bar in one column and falls short in the other. The hiring meeting is more than just tallying votes, otherwise it wouldn’t be necessary unless there were a tie. The effective Bar Raiser uses the Socratic method, asking questions that jump-start the critical thinking process, to lead and guide the dialogue with the goal that everyone, or at least the majority, will arrive at the same conclusion about the candidate. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=866))
1
- Instead, an effective Bar Raiser shares the right examples from the interview transcripts and asks the right probing questions of the interview panel and hiring manager to help them see why a candidate doesn’t meet or raise the bar. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=876))
1
- The hiring manager, not the recruiter, then calls the references to further explore and confirm the candidate’s skills and past performance. One question that often gets a telling response is, “If given the chance, would you hire this person again?” Another is, “Of the people you have managed or worked with, in what percentile would you place this candidate?” ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=895))
1
- The contact can be as simple as an email saying how excited you are about the candidate joining the team. Sometimes we would send a “book bomb” to a candidate—a stack of books we thought they would like—or a handful of their favorite DVDs. It could be a coffee or lunch. What matters is that the gesture be sincere and personal. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=910))
1
- This technique made it clear that when a candidate’s name implied the gender as female, an unconscious bias had been affecting the résumé screening. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=934))
1
- “The best way to fail at inventing something is by making it somebody’s part-time job.” ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=970))
1
- Speed, or more accurately velocity, which measures both speed and direction, matters in business. With all other things being equal, the organization that moves faster will innovate more, simply because it will be able to conduct a higher number of experiments per unit of time. Yet ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=994))
1
- “single-threaded leadership,” in which a single person, unencumbered by competing responsibilities, owns a single major initiative and heads up a separable, largely autonomous team to deliver its goals. ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1001))
1
- Each overlap created one kind of dependency, which describes something one team needs but can’t supply for itself. If my team’s work requires effort from yours—whether it’s to build something new, participate, or review—you’re one of my dependencies. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1020))
1
- Managing dependencies requires coordination—two or more people sitting down to hash out a solution—and coordination takes time. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1023))
1
- When a team is tasked with solving a particular problem and is judged by their solution, they should expect to have the tools and authority to complete the job. Their success should be a source of team pride. But Amazon’s tightly coupled software architecture and org structure too often made owners heavily dependent on outside teams, over whom they had little influence. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1106))
1
- We didn’t yet have the new solution, but we finally grasped the true identity of our problem: the ever-expanding cost of coordination among teams. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1117))
1
- In other words, Jeff’s vision was that we needed to focus on loosely coupled interaction via machines through well-defined APIs rather than via humans through emails and meetings. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1123))
1
- This gave rise to a process called New Project Initiatives (NPI), whose job was global prioritization. ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1129))
1
- It took quite a bit of work to prepare and submit an NPI request. You needed a “one-pager”; a written summary of the idea; an initial rough estimate of which teams would be impacted; a consumer adoption model, if applicable; a P&L; and an explanation of why it was strategically important for Amazon to embark on the initiative immediately. Just proposing the idea represented a resource-intensive undertaking. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1141))
1
- Morale is, in a sense, an output metric, whereas freedom to invent and build is an input metric. If you clear the impediment to building, morale takes care of itself. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1182))
1
- The team will own and be responsible for all aspects of its area of focus, including design, technology, and business results. This paradigm shift eliminates the all-too-often heard excuses such as, “We built what the business folks asked us to, they just asked for the wrong product,” or “If the tech team had actually delivered what we asked for and did it on time, we would have hit our numbers.” ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1210))
1
- The most successful teams invested much of their early time in removing dependencies and building “instrumentation”—our term for infrastructure used to measure every important action—before they began to innovate, meaning, add new features. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1274))
1
- Amazon’s SVP of Devices, Dave Limp, summed up nicely what might happen next: “The best way to fail at inventing something is by making it somebody’s part-time job.” ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1358))
1
- The other crucial component of the STL model is a separable, single-threaded team being run by a single-threaded leader like Tom. As Jeff Wilke explains, “Separable means almost as separable organizationally as APIs are for software. Single-threaded means they don’t work on anything else.” ([Location 1376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1376))
1
- As former Amazon VP Tom Killalea aptly observed, a good rule of thumb to see if a team has sufficient autonomy is deployment—can the team build and roll out their changes without coupling, coordination, and approvals from other teams? If the answer is no, then one solution is to carve out a small piece of functionality that can be autonomous and repeat. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1382))
1
- For example, with Amazon Echo and Alexa, were it not for the fact that Amazon VP Greg Hart was assigned to be the single-threaded leader, there might have been one person in charge of hardware and another in charge of software for all of Amazon’s devices—but no one whose job it was to create and launch Amazon Echo and Alexa as a whole. On the contrary, a single-threaded leader of Amazon Echo and Alexa had the freedom and autonomy to assess the novel product problems that needed to be solved, decide what and how many teams they needed, how the responsibilities should be divided up among the teams, and how big each team should be. ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1386))
1
- This journey is also a great example of another phrase you’ll hear at Amazon: be stubborn on the vision but flexible on the details. ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1396))
1
- At Amazon, after a brief exchange of greetings and chitchat, everyone sits at the table, and the room goes completely silent. Silent, as in not a word. The reason for the silence? A six-page document that everyone must read before discussion begins. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1412))
1
- “As analysis becomes more causal, multivariate, comparative, evidence based, and resolution-intense,” he writes, “the more damaging the bullet list becomes.” That description fit our discussions at the S-Team meetings: complex, interconnected, requiring plenty of information to explore, with greater and greater consequences connected to decisions. ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1434))
1
- Tufte offered wise advice on how to get started. “Making this transition in large organizations requires a straightforward executive order: From now on your presentation software is Microsoft Word, not PowerPoint. Get used to it.” That is essentially what ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1448))
1
- The real risk with using PowerPoint in the manner we did, however, was the effect it could have on decision-making. A dynamic presenter could lead a group to approve a dismal idea. A poorly organized presentation could confuse people, produce discussion that was rambling and unfocused, and rob good ideas of the serious consideration they deserved. A boring presentation could numb the brain so completely that people tuned out or started checking their email, thereby missing the good idea lurking beneath the droning voice and uninspiring visuals. ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1467))
1
- Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas. ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1475))
1
- helpful. The first is to call out one or more key tenets that our proposal relies upon—a foundational element of the reasoning that led us to make this recommendation. ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1647))
1
- Strong six-pagers don’t just make their case, they anticipate counterarguments, points of contention, or statements that might be easily misinterpreted. ([Location 1651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1651))
1
- An Amazon quarterly business review, for instance, might be broken down like this instead: Introduction Tenets Accomplishments Misses Proposals for Next Period Headcount P&L FAQ Appendices (includes things like supporting data in the form of spreadsheets, tables and charts, mock-ups) ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1658))
1
- he assumes each sentence he reads is wrong until he can prove otherwise. He’s challenging the content of the sentence, not the motive of the writer. Jeff, by the way, was usually among the last to finish reading. ([Location 1705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1705))
1
- “If Amazon is really customer obsessed, why do we penalize the 99 percent of customers who are honest and want to return an item by making them wait until our returns department receives the item to make sure it’s the right item and that it’s not damaged?” This type of thinking—in which you assume there is something wrong with the sentence—led Amazon to create the no-hassle return policy, which specifies that the customer should get a refund even before Amazon receives the returned goods. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1713))
1
- We were working forward, trying to invent a product that would be good for Amazon, the company, not the customer. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1860))
1
- The PR gives the reader the highlights of the customer experience. The FAQ provides all the salient details of the customer experience as well as a clear-eyed and thorough assessment of how expensive and challenging it will be for the company to build the product or create the service. ([Location 1881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1881))
1
- The press release (PR) portion is a few paragraphs, always less than one page. The frequently asked questions (FAQ) should be five pages or less. There are no awards for extra pages or more words. The goal isn’t to explain all the excellent work you have done but rather to share the distilled thinking that has come from that work. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1888))
1
- The creation of the PR/FAQ starts with the person who originated either the idea or the project writing a draft. When it’s in shareable condition, that person sets up a one-hour meeting with stakeholders to review the document and get feedback. At the meeting, they distribute the PR/FAQ in either soft or hard copy, and everyone reads it to themselves. When they have finished, the writer asks for general feedback. The most senior attendees tend to speak last, to avoid influencing others. ([Location 1897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1897))
1
- Press Release Components ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2005))
1
- Heading: Name the product in a way the reader (i.e., your target customers) will understand. One sentence under the title. ([Location 2006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2006))
1
- Subheading: Describe the customer for the product and what benefits they will gain from using it. One sentence only underneath the heading. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2009))
1
- Summary Paragraph: Begin with the city, media outlet, and your proposed launch date. Give a summary of the product and the benefit. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2012))
1
- Problem Paragraph: This is where you describe the problem that your product is designed to solve. Make sure that you write this paragraph from the customer’s point of view. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2016))
1
- Solution Paragraph(s): Describe your product in some detail and how it simply and easily solves the customer’s problem. For more complex products, you may need more than one paragraph. ([Location 2019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2019))
1
- Quotes and Getting Started: Add one quote from you or your company’s spokesperson and a second quote from a hypothetical customer in which they describe the benefit they are getting from using your new product. Describe how easy it is to get started, and provide a link to your website where customers can get more information and purchase the product. ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2022))
1
- The PR section does not typically include visuals, but it is more than appropriate to include tables, graphs, and charts in the FAQ. You must include things like your pro forma P&L for a new business or product. If you have high-quality mock-ups or wireframes, they can be included as an appendix. ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2028))

- Consumer Needs and Total Addressable Market (TAM) How many consumers have this need or problem? How big is the need? For how many consumers is this problem big enough that they are willing to spend money to do something about it? If so, how much money would they be willing to spend? How many of these consumers have the characteristics/capabilities/constraints necessary to make use of the product?

- Economics and P&L What are the per-unit economics of the device? That is, what is the expected gross profit and contribution profit per unit? What is the rationale for the price point you have chosen for the product? How much will we have to invest up front to build this product in terms of people, technology, inventory, warehouse space, and so on?

- For new products, the up-front investment is a major consideration. In the case of Melinda, there is a requirement for 77 people to work on the hardware and software, for an annualized cost of roughly $15 million. This means that the product idea needs to have the potential to earn well in excess of $15 million per year in gross profit to be worth building.

- The bill of materials (BOM), however, comes to $250. Now you have two choices to suggest. First, alter the specs, strip out features, or take other actions that will reduce the BOM to below $99. Second, construct a financial plan that shows heavy losses in the early days of release, but also shows that the losses can eventually be mitigated with BOM reductions as the product achieves scale or can be enhanced with some additional source of revenue (e.g., an associated service or subscription).

- A common mistake among less-seasoned product managers is to not fully consider how third parties who have their own agendas and incentives will interact with their product idea, or what potential regulatory or legal issues might arise.

- Leadership and management are often about deciding what not to do rather than what to do. Bringing clarity to why you aren’t doing something is often as important as having clarity about what you are doing. ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2111))

- Before you can improve any system … you must understand how the inputs affect the outputs of the system. You must be able to change the inputs (and possibly the system) in order to achieve the desired results. This will require a sustained effort, constancy of purpose, and an environment where continual improvement is the operating philosophy.

- Better customer experience leads to more traffic. More traffic attracts more sellers seeking those buyers. More sellers lead to wider selection. Wider selection enhances customer experience, completing the circle. The cycle drives growth, which in turn lowers cost structure. Lower costs lead to lower prices, improving customer experience, and the flywheel spins faster. ([Location 2208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2208))

- Charlie Bell, an SVP in AWS and a great operational guru at Amazon, put it aptly when he said, “When you encounter a problem, the probability you’re actually looking at the actual root cause of the problem in the initial 24 hours is pretty close to zero, because it turns out that behind every issue there’s a very interesting story.” ([Location 2311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2311))

- On the first day of training, we listened to the CS agent handle a few calls. On one call, the customer complained that her lawn furniture had arrived damaged. The CS agent asked for the product number. As the customer was looking for it, the CS agent muted the call, and said to us, “I bet she’s referring to this lawn chair,” and pointed to the product on the Amazon site. Sure enough, when the customer read out the number from the packing slip it was the one that the CS had predicted it would be. Jeff and I raised our eyebrows in surprise but didn’t want to interrupt the call. After the issue had been resolved and the call ended, Jeff asked, “How did you know the customer was going to say this?” The CS agent responded that it happened quite often with this newly listed product. The packaging was inadequate, and the furniture often got banged or bruised in transit. Jeff had recently been learning about how Toyota approached quality control and continuous improvement.
