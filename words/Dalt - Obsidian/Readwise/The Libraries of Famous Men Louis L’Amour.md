A - The Libraries of Famous Men: Louis L’Amour

1
- To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zfj023t3rqs66n3906p32y))

- As L’Amour suggests:
  > “For those who have not been readers, my advice is to read what entertains you. Reading is fun. Reading is adventure. It is not important what you read at first, only that you read ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81yzy7t69ec4gnzq7je16pj))

- “If I were asked what education should give, I would say it should offer breadth of view, ease of understanding, tolerance for others, and a background from which the mind can explore in any direction. Education should provide the tools for a widening and deepening of life, for increased appreciation of all one sees or experiences. It should equip a person to live life well, to understand what is happening about him.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zftp5sxyysf85gq5cw007e))

- A book is less important for what it says than for what it makes you think.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81z0qt889aaxptfzc922tyt))

- “Often I hear people say they do not have time to read. That’s absolute nonsense. In the one year during which I kept that kind of record, I read twenty-five books while waiting for people. In offices, applying for jobs, waiting to see a dentist, waiting in a restaurant for friends, many such places. I read on buses, trains, and planes. If one really wants to learn, one has to decide what is important. Spending an evening on the town? Attending a ball game? Or learning something that can be with you your life long?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zfvby5424vhg9tr9x7tfr8))

- I have enjoyed digging into the reading habits of many great men and women and have tried where possible to get a list of the books in their libraries. . . . I hoped that by understanding the books these men and women read I might grasp at the basic sources of some of their ideas.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81z239qqtg0e6g1s9gzvy3c))
