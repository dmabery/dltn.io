- Kendrick Lamar one of the world's best writers.
  His recent album, Damn, won a Grammy and a Pulitzer-Prize award. His writing is propelled by a note-taking system that helps him capturing the ideas behind his lyrics.
  Here's what you can learn from his note-taking system. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1374391212736610306))

    - Note: Save

- 1. Note-taking is the closest thing we have to time-travel.
  By taking notes, Kendrick conserves precious ideas, develops them over time, and eventually turns them into art. Taking notes doesn't just help him save ideas. It helps him return to a different state of consciousness. https://t.co/eU2eZGts7T ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1374391213793574921))

- 2. Start taking notes early, so you can build upon the ideas over time.
  Kendrick was a shy middle schooler who sometimes spoke with a stutter. Frustrated, he turned to the written word. He scribbled rap lyrics on notebook paper instead of finishing assignments for other classes. https://t.co/IE6Glw3vVr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1374391256894173186))

- 3. Build a library of ideas that you can save easily and instantly search for the rest of your life.
  As Kendrick learned at a young age, note-taking helps you build an extended mind, which turns writer's block into a problem of the past.

- 4. Let ideas grow slowly 
  Kendrick doesn't write from a blank page. Instead, he writes with an abundance of notes that he accumulates by capturing notes during his everyday life. He's described his creative process as a perpetual one. https://t.co/0o9OcAQGBa ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1374391311181082633))

- 5. Collect interesting ideas, even when you don't know how you'll use them.
  Kendrick spends most of his time in an intuition-driven process of collecting interesting ideas. 80% time is thinking about how he's going to execute, which makes it "easy" for him to write lyrics. https://t.co/K5gU1nPZMH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1374391314679140358))

- 6. Capture ideas when you have them, so you can write about them clearly later. 
  The opening track of "Damn" is called Blood. You can see the influence of Kendrick's note-taking system with his story at the beginning of the album. https://t.co/x1qCpiieOA ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1374391319871725577))
