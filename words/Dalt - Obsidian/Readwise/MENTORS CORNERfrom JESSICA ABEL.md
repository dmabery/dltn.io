1
- Get yourself a calendar, and schedule the work you have to do in there.
  Make sure the calendar is the type where you can see a day or a week at at time (not a month at a time), so there's room to write under each day. Then, mark in any regular commitments you have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ynst0y4qa6xqcqjpezmhwz))

- Once you've got all that there, you will be able to see how much time you really have to work (and if you need to make adjustments to your daily activities that aren't work). In the time you have for work, assign yourself very specific tasks--like "lay out pages 56-60" for half an hour, then "rough pencil page 56" for however long it takes you--maybe 2 or 3 hours, then "letter page 56" for an hour or whatever.
