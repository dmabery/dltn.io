A - How Bestselling Author Austin Kleon Writes: Part One

1
- For me, I just put [this post](https://medium.com/show-your-work/okay-campers-rise-and-shine-and-don-t-forget-your-booties-de719bc80e8d) up online recently. It was a little talk I gave about how everybody thinks creativity is like Don Draper closing his eyes and then having a big revelation. I never feel like Don Draper. I always feel like Phil Connors in [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)). Phil wakes up every day at 6 am, and he’s got to do something with his day. He knows there’s no tomorrow. He knows all he’s got is this day. I love that movie because, at first, he cheats, he fritters away the day, and then he falls into despair. Then, at the end, he realizes, “I just have to work. I have to practice a craft, or I just put the work in every day,” and that’s when his life gets better.
  As an artist or a writer, you really just have to get in to the dailyness. You have to figure out a daily routine in which you go out and you do your work, and then, if you have a daily practice and a ritual, you’re insulated from success and failure because they’ll both screw you up. Failure, we all know about. Success will do the same thing. It will knock you off your game, but if you have this dailyness to your work, that will pull you through so many situations. That’s why I love Mason Currey’s book [Daily Rituals](http://masoncurrey.com/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ygcmamb6yat00f2xgyevmm))

- If you show up every day and you do the work, those little bits and pieces of effort, over time, they add up into something.
  You write a page a day, it doesn’t seem like much in the day, and then at the end of the year, you got enough for a novel, 305 pages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ygeb2573yjych31ztzh9rd))

- Novelists will come to me, or fiction writers, they’re like, “Should I put drafts of my stories online?” I’m like “No. Don’t put drafts of your stories online. Save your drafts for your really close readers and for your writing group or your wife or whoever. What you should be doing is write about the books you’re reading, talk about a writing tool that you found really helpful, or talk about structure in a Hemingway story you’re reading.” Do that kind of stuff, that process-y stuff that you think no one cares about.

    - Note: some real practical examples of what show your work means
1
- Every fiction writer should be posting a list of books they’re reading. That’s the easiest thing in the world to do. From a marketing perspective, throw an associate’s code in there, and anyone who buys the book, get something back from it. I’m always amazed at writers who don’t tell people what they’re reading. I think a lot of people think that reading’s a personal thing. The reason people read you is that they’re hungry for the types of books you write, so if you read those types of books, too … ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2yghy6xxtj6cqj2mdg7xnt2))

- I also think that people hit walls, and a lot of times when nothing’s coming, when the output doesn’t happen, that’s because there’s problems of input. A lot of times problems of output are problems of input. If you don’t have anything coming out, that means there’s not good stuff going in. That could be anything from you need to take a trip, or you need to just walk away from your desk, or you need to stare at a wall for a while or read — just something to get something jump-started.

- That’s a Joseph Campbell thing. Everybody’s heard the ‘follow your bliss’ thing from Joseph Campbell, but the one thing Joseph Campbell talked about in that, too, was having a [bliss station](https://books.google.com/books?id=jQQdk6YszYIC&pg=PA115&dq=%22bliss+station%22+campbell&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KuFkT7ewL6vMsQKKtcS3Dw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22bliss%20station%22%20campbell&f=false), having a place where you can go, and no one’s going to bother you, and you feel very much at home, and you can do your work without the world impinging on it. For me, that’s the garage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ygpgr9zzctq3c7wksdn604))

- I just think so many of the writing programs, they’re just everything else. They’re just way too complicated. Just open a box and type in to it. That’s why I love TextEdit on the Mac. I just open that up, make the font really big, and start typing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ygqdtscq6be8f3xghz2fw8))
