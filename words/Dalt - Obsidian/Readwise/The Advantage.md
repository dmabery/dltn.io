B - The Advantage

1
- The health of an organization provides the context for strategy, finance, marketing, technology, and everything else that happens within it, which is why it is the single greatest factor determining an organization’s success. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=336))
1
- it is whole, consistent, and complete, that is, when its management, operations, strategy, and culture fit together and make sense. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=364))
1
- A good way to recognize health is to look for the signs that indicate an organization has it. These include minimal politics and confusion, high degrees of morale and productivity, and very low turnover among good employees. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=377))
1
- Most leaders prefer to look for answers where the light is better, where they are more comfortable. And the light is certainly better in the measurable, objective, and data-driven world of organizational intelligence (the smart side of the equation) than it is in the messier, more unpredictable world of organizational health. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=401))
1
- After two decades of working with CEOs and their teams of senior executives, I’ve become absolutely convinced that the seminal difference between successful companies and mediocre or unsuccessful ones has little, if anything, to do with what they know or how smart they are; it has everything to do with how healthy they are. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=424))
1
- An organization that is healthy will inevitably get smarter over time. That’s because people in a healthy organization, beginning with the leaders, learn from one another, identify critical issues, and recover quickly from mistakes. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=435))
1
- They fail to see that the real deficiency, the one that makes it possible for smart people to make dumb decisions, is a lack of organizational health. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=463))
1
- The healthier an organization is, the more of its intelligence it is able to tap into and use. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=466))
1
- DISCIPLINE 1: BUILD A COHESIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=514))
1
- DISCIPLINE 2: CREATE CLARITY ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=518))
1
- DISCIPLINE 3: OVERCOMMUNICATE CLARITY ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=522))
1
- DISCIPLINE 4: REINFORCE CLARITY ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=526))
1
- people who are collectively responsible for achieving a common objective for their organization. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=584))
1
- Advocacy is the kind of communication that most people are accustomed to, and it is all about stating your case or making your point. I think we should change our advertising approach. Or, I recommend that we cut costs. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=595))
1
- Inquiry is rarer and more important than advocacy. It happens when people ask questions to seek clarity about another person’s statement of advocacy. Why do you think the advertising approach is wrong? ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=597))
1
- decision making within an organization. Inclusivity, or the basic idea behind it, should be achieved by ensuring that the members of a leadership team are adequately representing and tapping into the opinions of the people who work for them, not by maximizing the size of the team. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=614))
1
- The only reason that a person should be on a team is that she represents a key part of the organization or brings truly critical talent or insight to the table. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=637))
1
- Collective responsibility implies, more than anything else, selflessness and shared sacrifices from team members. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=645))
1
- Finally, if a team shares a common objective, a good portion of their compensation or reward structure, though not necessarily all of it, should be based on the achievement of that common objective. ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=668))
1
- When leaders preach teamwork but exclusively reward individual achievement, they are confusing their people and creating an obstacle to true team behavior. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=669))
1
- The kind of trust that is necessary to build a great team is what I call vulnerability-based trust. This is what happens when members get to a point where they are completely comfortable being transparent, honest, and naked with one another, where they say and genuinely mean things like “I screwed up,” ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=681))
1
- At the heart of vulnerability lies the willingness of people to abandon their pride and their fear, to sacrifice their egos for the collective good of the team. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=690))
1
- fundamental attribution error. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=777))
1
- attribution error is the tendency of human beings to attribute the negative or frustrating behaviors of their colleagues to their intentions and personalities, while attributing their own negative or frustrating behaviors to environmental factors. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=779))
1
- BEHAVIOR 2: MASTERING CONFLICT ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=862))
1
- Conflict without trust, however, is politics, an attempt to manipulate others in order to win an argument regardless of the truth. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=871))
1
- When people fail to be honest with one another about an issue they disagree on, their disagreement around that issue festers and ferments over time until it transforms into frustration around that person. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=910))
1
- Conflict is about issues and ideas, while accountability is about performance and behavior. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=1199))
1
- Other distractions include a concern for individual career development, budget allocations, status, and ego, all of them common distractions that prevent teams from being obsessed with achieving results. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=1271))
1
- The second is run by a group of well-intentioned executives who have a good understanding of the details of their business. But they don’t spend much time thinking or talking about why their organization exists or what values should drive their behaviors. ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=1394))
