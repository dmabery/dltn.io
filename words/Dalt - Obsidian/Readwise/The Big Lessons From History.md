A - The Big Lessons From History

1
- An imperfect rule of thumb is that the more granular the lesson, the less useful it is to the future. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658651))
1
- The same rule of thumb works in the other direction: the broader the lesson, the more useful it is for the future. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658669))
1
- It’s hard to convince someone that they’re in danger of a risk they assume had been defeated. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658678))
1
- Some of why “it’s just the flu” became a phrase this year is because it’s normal to cling to something you’re familiar with when confronted with something you’re not. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658681))
1
- Two things have plunged in the last 80 years: death from bacterial infection, and funding/development of new antibiotics that will combat future infections. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658691))
1
- Calm plants the seeds of crazy. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658698))

- Carl Jung had a theory called enantiodromia. It’s the idea that an excess of something gives rise to its opposite. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658699))
1
- When there are no recessions, people get confident. When they get confident they take risks. When they take risks, you get recessions. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658700))
1
- Nothing too good or too bad stays that way forever, because great times plant the seeds of their own destruction through complacency and leverage, and bad times plant the seeds of their own turnaround through opportunity and panic-driven problem-solving. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658709))
1
- Embrace that the short run is a continuous chain of setbacks and disappointments, problems and embarrassments, breakages, recessions, depressions, bear markets, pandemics, and errors.
  But none of those prevent the long run from being able to compound into something glorious. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658715))
1
- It’s intuitive to think you should either be an optimist or a pessimist. It’s hard to realize there’s a time and a place for both, and that the two can – and should – coexist. But it’s what you see in almost every successful long-term endeavor. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658724))
1
- The business that takes huge risks with new products, like an optimist, but is terrified of short-term debt and always wants a big chunk of safety-net cash, like a pessimist.
  The worker who turns down a lucrative opportunity because it might come at the expense of their reputation, which over the long run is exponentially more valuable. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658725))
1
- An important lesson from history is that the long run is usually pretty good and the short run is usually pretty bad. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658726))
1
- Lesson #3: People believe what they want to believe, see what they want to see, and hear what they want to hear. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658728))
1
- Lesson #2: Progress requires optimism and pessimism to coexist. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658729))
1
- In 1997 a religious cult called Heaven’s Gate believed a spaceship traveling behind a comet was heading to Earth to pick up true believers and carry them to paradise.
  Several cult members pitched in to buy a high-powered telescope. They wanted to see the spaceship with their own eyes.
  They found the comet in the sky. But there was no spaceship following it.
  So they took the telescope back to the store for a refund. The store manager asked if there was something wrong. They said yes, the telescope was clearly broken – because it didn’t show the spaceship.
  There’s a long history of people believing what they want to believe.
  And not just cult members. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658736))
1
- When met with the problem, “Either the model of how I think the world works is wrong, or this other person is wrong,” the path of least resistance is always to point at the other person. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658755))
1
- The most powerful way to get someone to believe something is not to show them facts, because facts can be interpreted in different ways. It’s to make their income or approval in a social circle depend on believing it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658756))
1
- An important lesson from history is that everyone sees the world through a different lens, and incentives can cause smart people to embrace and defend ideas that range from goofy to disastrous. It shows up all over the place. The same story, again and again. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658758))
1
- One is when several things occur at once. In his documentary on American history, Oliver Stone says, “Real history is the story of lots of things happening at the same time.”
  The Great Depression, for example, was a stock market crash and a banking crash and a real estate bubble and an agricultural disaster and a poor policy response. None of those things on their own were that big a deal. But when they happened at the same time – wham, it was a catastrophe. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658760))
1
- Covid-19 is similar. A virus transferred from animal to humans (has happened forever) and those humans socialized with other people (of course). It was a mystery for a while (small sample size) and then bad news was then likely suppressed (hoping it would soon end). Other countries thought it would be contained (standard denial) and didn’t act fast enough (bureaucracy, lack of leadership). We weren’t prepared (over-optimism) and could only respond with blunt-force lockdowns (do what you gotta do) and panic (calm plants the seeds of crazy).

1
- Viewing events in isolation makes it easier to place blame or admiration on a single person. It’s not until you study an event’s long roots that you recognize the chain of events that leads to something meaningful happening. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658764))
1
- An important lesson from history is that big events are more complicated than we make them out to be – and the bigger the event, the more complexity. It makes forecasting hard, politics nasty, and learning specific lessons from big events harder than we’d like to think. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658766))
1
- Lesson #5: Risk is what you don’t see. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658768))
1
- Harry Houdini used to invite the strongest man in the audience on stage. Then he’d ask the man to punch him in the stomach as hard as he could.
  Houdini was an amateur boxer, and told crowds he could withstand any man’s punch with barely a flinch. The stunt matched what people loved about his famous escapes: the idea that his body could conquer physics.
  After a show in 1926 Houdini invited a group of students backstage to meet him. One, a guy named Gordon Whitehead, walked up and started punching Houdini in the stomach without warning.
  Whitehead didn’t mean any harm. He thought he was just performing the same trick he saw Houdini pull off on stage.
  But Houdni wasn’t prepared to be punched like he would be on stage. He wasn’t flexing his solar plexus, steadying his stance, and holding his breath like he normally would before the trick. Whitehead caught him off guard. Houdini waved him off, clearly in pain.
  The next day Houdini woke up doubled over in pain.
  His appendix was ruptured, almost certainly from Whitehead’s punches.
  And then Harry Houdini died. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658771))

- The riskiest stuff is always what you don’t see coming.
  Houdini was once handcuffed, placed inside a dead whale’s stomach, and escaped through its mouth, nearly suffocating in the process. Another time he dug his way out from being buried six feet underground in a casket wearing a straight jacket.
  He could survive all of those because he was prepared. He knew what was coming.
  The one thing he wasn’t prepared for – an innocent student’s jab – killed him.
  Risk always works like that. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658773))
1
- The biggest risk is what no one sees coming, because if no one sees it coming no one’s prepared for it, and if no one’s prepared for it its damage will be amplified when it arrives. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658774))
1
- An important lesson from history is that the risks we talk about in the news are rarely the most important risks in hindsight. We saw that over the last decade of economists and investors spending their lives discussing the biggest risk to the economy – was it Ben Bernanke’s monetary policy? Barack Obama’s fiscal policy? Donald Trump’s trade wars?
  No, none of those. It was a virus. Out of the blue, causing havoc we couldn’t comprehend.
  The same story, again and again. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363887169/14658780))
