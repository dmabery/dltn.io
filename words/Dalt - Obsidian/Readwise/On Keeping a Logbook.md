A - On Keeping a Logbook

1
- From the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook) entry for “logbook”:
  > A logbook was originally a book for recording readings from the log, and is used to determine the distance a ship traveled within a certain amount of time. The readings of the log have been recorded in equal times to give the distance traveled with respect to a given start position.
  *The distance the ship traveled*. I like that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnr0d897hh5krb3r49efz137))
