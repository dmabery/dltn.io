A - Tom Hanks on the Rewards and “Vicious Reality” of Making Movies

1
- **Do you think moviemaking defeats journalism and required writing a novel? Also, writing a novel is hard. Why did you want to be the guy to reveal how this is done?**
  Writing a novel is not that hard. Writing a novel that anybody wants to read is hard. Anybody can sit down for a few hours every morning for a couple of months and bang out something that’s going to last about three hundred and sixty pages. Whether or not it’s a piece of crap or not—that’s where it’s going to come down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pzcvmnf9k1p93pfq3sh7k6))

    - Note: writing isn't hard...writing a book or a newsletter or making vidoes that people actually want to watch...is hard

- Let me put it this way. You ran away from your miserable life and your horrible, abusive family to join the circus when it came through town, because it was a number of things: It was glamorous. It was an escape from your life of missed opportunities. And you work on that circus now, and you join it, and you are on the road, and you tear down that tent, and you put it back up every Thursday. What’s required of you, as a member of the circus, is to make sure that the net for the trapeze artists will actually save their lives when they fall from the sky. Suddenly you’re not just a member of the circus. You have a life-and-death responsibility for the safety of somebody else that you work with every day. Making a movie also has this vicious reality to it: they last forever. So, if you’ve done a shitty job in whatever your responsibility on that movie is, it will haunt you for the rest of your days.

- Anyway, we were shooting “Forrest Gump” in Cherokee Square, in Savannah, Georgia. We’re on the world-famous park bench. We’ve got various props. There was so much dialogue. And I was so exhausted because we had shot twenty-seven days straight. Remember how Forrest ran across the country? Well, there’s only one way to get those scenes, in those days. You had to fly to the goddam place, put on the costume, run for an hour and a half, then go back, get on the plane, and then fly to, say, New Hampshire, and do it all over again. So I’m exhausted. I don’t know what’s going on. The scenes on the park bench have oceans of dialogue, and we shot them in a day and a half. And I said to Bob––the director, Robert Zemeckis––“Bob, my head is fragile, frazzled. We’re doing all these scenarios with different people, and every one of them has a page and a half of dialogue. I will never be able to keep this in my head.”
  “Oh, don’t worry, Tom. We’ll shoot it like ‘I Love Lucy.’ We’ll have four cameras. We’ll put the words up on cards if you need it. You can just read ’em.”
  I said, “Oh, great, thank you. Let’s make this an even more artificial atmosphere!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pzkf36cbhsgdkcp4pryzm2))

- And so Bob Zemeckis, God bless him—I’ve worked with him more than once—landed on the absolute truth of anybody who has gone forward and said, We are going to commit something to film today. You do not know if it is going to work out. You can only have faith. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pzmcmdwjw1jqy1n3mpjqa3))

- **So you worked on “Bonfire of the Vanities,” which didn’t succeed, and you worked on “Saving Private Ryan,” which did. Don’t you know if they’re going to be any good while you’re in the middle of making them?**
  No. There’s no way to tell, because the process is so slow. And so specific. You can only have faith and hope—and what’s bigger than faith and hope? You have to trust the entire process to collaborators who you hope are working at the absolute top of their game farther down the line.

- The fifth Rubicon is time. Where that movie lands twenty years after the fact. What happens when people look at it, perhaps by accident. And a great example of this is “It’s a Wonderful Life,” which was made [in 1946] and disappeared for the better part of, I’m going to say, twenty years, locked up in a rights issue. It wasn’t even viewed at the time as being a commercial hit. Enough people liked it, so it was nominated for Best Picture. [The film only became a universally admired Christmas classic after the copyright ran out in 1974 and it entered the public domain, becoming a television constant.]
  For me, it happened on a movie that I wrote and directed called “That Thing You Do!” I loved making that movie. I loved writing it, I loved being with it. I love all the people in it. When it came out, it was completely dismissed by the first wave of vox populi. It didn’t do great business. It hung around for a while, was viewed as being some sort of odd, kinda quasi-ripoff of nine other different movies and a nice little stroll down memory lane. Now the same exact publications that dismissed it in their initial review called it “Tom Hanks’s cult classic, ‘That Thing You Do!’ ” So now it’s a cult classic. What was the difference between those two things? The answer is time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pzqw0c989xp7qwh34k8j6g))

- I realized that one of the things that was driving me nuts about the project is that Nora and Delia Ephron, who helped on the screenplay, are—
  **Sisters.**
  Sisters, but they are also mothers. It was a movie about a father. And I said, “You guys are the wrong gender to understand what’s going on in this scene between me and my son.”
  **A remark like that always goes well.**
  And she loved it. “Oh, Tom, tell me more.” And the argument I had was “You have written a scene in which a father is undone by the fact that his son is upset about him going out with a woman.” Oh, no. I said, “There is not a father on the planet Earth who is gonna give a rat’s ass what his son thinks about him going out with a woman. Because you know what that father wants to do? He wants to get laid. And that’s what’s missing from your little gender-ish scene that you wrote.” And she said, “Well, then, why don’t you say that?” That was a very empowering moment. She would often say this: “Well, when you’re right, you’re right.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pzvnf786wcw5mmfyd59g2r))

- Later on, I said, “It was great that you let that happen, in the cumulative, collaborative process of making a movie.” And she said, “Well, you wrote that.” I said, “No, Nora Ephron, I did not write that. I complained at you in rehearsal, and you decided to put it into the movie.” But she said, “That’s what writing is.” I said, “Writing is sitting down and complaining on paper? That’s what writing is?” She says, “Mmm, yeah.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pzw6c8bzdqsp6ax3v8f6j5))

- Bob [Zemeckis] had this idea, which was “You know”—this goes into how you make a movie—“are we really gonna go down to, like, Fiji, and put you in a fat suit, and then take the fat suit away, and stick a wig on you, and glue a beard on? That stuff won’t even stay on your face down in that humidity and with all that salt water. If we were really bold, you know what we’d do?”
  “What would we do, Bob?”
  “You’d get really fat, and we’d go shoot the first half of the movie. Then we’d take a year off and you’d lose all that weight and we’ll shoot the second half of the movie.”
  And that’s what we did. And it would be virtually impossible to do now. You could probably do it through C.G.I. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pzy0zgkjmmyfxh132q3rm1))

- So much so that now the first two paragraphs of any review of any of my movies are actually about all the other movies I’ve ever made. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1q00bj21yf890cfdsjhermz))

- Seventeen minutes into it, you think, I have no investment in this movie whatsoever. I don’t like this movie. I’m going to leave the room and not bother watching the rest of this movie. Right? How many times? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1q03mkdx6a9bmben2w2j25g))

- **How do you view this quandary that we all face, whether in work or life or love or family or just in our brief time on this planet: the business of getting older?**
  I will tell you that, no matter where you are in your arc, no matter where you are as far as your age goes, your body, your wherewithal, you still get to come back to this empirical truth: you start at the beginning of whatever story you’re telling, and you just work your way through it. I am sixty-six years old. I got my first job as an actor when I was twenty, at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, in Cleveland, Ohio. And the requirements then were the same exact ones now: Learn the lines. Start at the beginning. Tell the whole story till you get to the end.
