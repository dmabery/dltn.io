A - Your Thinking Rate Is Fixed

1
- Speeding up often results in poor decisions that create future problems.
  The reason more pressure doesn’t mean better productivity is that the rate at which we think is fixed. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393273639/15752599))

- Chances are good that you’re already going as fast as you can. Because guess what? You can’t voluntarily slow down your thinking, either. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393273639/15752609))

- Deferring non-critical tasks doesn’t save any time overall, it just pushes work forwards—to the point where those tasks do become critical. Then something else gets deferred. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393273639/15752618))

- Staying late might work once in a while. Again, though, its effects are limited. If we keep doing it night after night, we run out of energy, our personal lives suffer, and we make worse decisions as a result. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393273639/15752625))

- None of the outcomes of increasing pressure result in more or better decisions. None of them speed up the rate at which people think.

- When you’re under pressure, the quality of your decisions plummets. You miss possible angles, you don’t think ahead, you do what makes sense now, you panic, and so on.

- If you want to make better decisions, you need to do everything you can to reduce the pressure you’re under. You need to let your brain take whatever time it needs to think through the problem at hand. You need to get out of a reactive mode, recognize when you need to pause, and spend more time looking at problems. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1393273639/15752656))
