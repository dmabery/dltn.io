A - Cycle Time

1
- Cycle time is a function of how many vertical leaps a discussion has to traverse and how many people are involved at each level. The best way to reduce cycle time is to reduce vertical leaps because it affects both variables. In layman’s terms, this means the most important change to make is to push decision making down. The target isn’t a true “bottoms up” culture so much as a culture of strong local leadership. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0b8zs5hcc7x2htaa7wsa5b))

- Another way to improve cycle time is by having fewer levels to traverse when a decision does need vertical leaps and reducing the latency of escalations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bd37dt4pz7mqmhpcd06qx))

- One thing that helps with that is assigning a Single Threaded Owner for each critical area of work. That is someone who is 100% focused on the task at hand and has no other responsibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bacm84v7rfdkysjf3khry))

- Another way to improve cycle time is by reducing the number of people involved in each loop. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bczrrkc982kskspdgj49c))

- A document with 50 co-authors is not a well owned document. It represents an extremely poor use of time for everyone and a very diffuse accountability for the content. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bb3vcz8dvqdrqabj443af))
1
- Another way to improve cycle time is to make decisions more durable so the cycle doesn’t have to repeat later. One way we have found to do that is make decisions on demos and prototypes rather than docs and decks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bbwbnxgb3dpbmfbr04jgd))

- Another way to improve cycle time is to do less. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bckrd0gc9vvj52160bwr2))

- Another way to improve cycle time is to eliminate bottlenecks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bcnyexyq1re0qaw00e1gr))

- The final optimization for cycle time is making sure the process for managing it is smooth. Good processes make things go faster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0bcv11tr89k519kp1mz4zz))
