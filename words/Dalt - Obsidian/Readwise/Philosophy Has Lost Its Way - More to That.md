A - Philosophy Has Lost Its Way - More to That

1
- You may be inclined to believe that you are an independent thinker with reliable intuitions, but without the sharp tool of timeless wisdom, your conclusions of the world are shoddily grounded by personal experience.
  And if you rely solely on personal experience to draft your map of reality, be prepared to fall off a cliff when reality gives you an unpleasant update. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353694))

- In the world of academia, philosophy has become this weird playground of technicality and complexity that separates the curious masses from the intellectual elite. Instead of focusing on the timeless principles that increase human well-being, it has turned into a pithy battle about what certain words mean and whether or not a certain remark is true.

- The greatest enemy of intellectual curiosity isn’t boredom, but needless complexity. Boredom can force you to look outside your comfort zone, but complexity constructs a stone wall barrier that intimidates and scares you away. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353745))

    - Note: This is so true. How can I increase simplicity in an area of education for people? It's becoming easier in Software, but still some stuff is just way too complicated and gated.

- Science tells us what the world is made of, how it works, and how we can use its components to build tools that help us understand it even better. It is the gathering of information and the rigorous filtration of it that leaves us with the end result: knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353756))

- The goal of philosophy is to understand how you can use your factual knowledge to lead a life well-lived. If science gives us a beautiful photograph of the Earth, philosophy provides the realization that we are all in this game together. Now that you are more informed of how the world works, how will you position yourself to live a more fruitful existence? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353779))

- If philosophy had a string of cumulative results to its name – as physics does and biology does – and we unmistakably know more than we did a couple of centuries ago . . . [then] I accept the parallel [between philosophy and science].
  But there’s no evidence that it is like that.
  Very basic questions keep recurring and being handled again and again in different ways. So the more apt comparison I see would be with humane studies, like with history and literature – perhaps art itself. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353859))

- Philosophy, however, is a timeless discipline, meaning that the questions that were asked thousands of years ago are still unsolved and relevant today. The “why” questions about existence don’t have definitive answers, and we will spend all of our lives trying to sort through them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353866))

- In philosophy, it is often the pursuit of the question that is more interesting than the answer, and this paradox is what makes the field much more of an art, and less of a science. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353904))

- Now let’s bring philosophy back into the picture. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528540575/20353933))
