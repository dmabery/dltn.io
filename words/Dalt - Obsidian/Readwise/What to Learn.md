A - What to Learn

1
- If you watch an anime or a TV series "about" fighting, people often improve by increasing the number of techniques they know because that's an easy thing to depict but, in real life, getting better at techniques you already know is often more effective than having a portfolio of hundreds of "moves".

- One piece of advice I got at some point was to amplify my strengths. All of us have strengths and weaknesses and we spend a lot of time talking about ‘areas of improvement.’ It can be easy to feel like the best way to advance is to eliminate all of those. However, it can require a lot of work and energy to barely move the needle if it’s truly an area we’re weak in. Obviously, you still want to make sure you don’t have any truly bad areas, but assuming you’ve gotten that, instead focus on amplifying your strengths. How can you turn something you’re good at into your superpower? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1511462467/19727218))

- I'll say that working on a few things and not being particularly well rounded has worked for me in multiple disparate fields and it appears to work for a lot of other folks as well. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1511462467/19727221))

- For me, two ingredients for figuring out what to spend time learning are having a relative aptitude for something (relative to other things I might do, not relative to other people) and also having a good environment in which to learn.

- In retrospect, when people said things like "Forth is very productive", what I suspect they really meant was "Forth makes me very productive and I have not considered how well this generalizes to people with different aptitudes or who are operating in different contexts" ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1511462467/19727224))

- Another way to find these is to look for things you can't help but do that most other people don't seem to do, which is true for me of both "looking at data" and "having an adversarial mindset". ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1511462467/19727225))

- Moreover, I don't think I could've learned as quickly on my own or by trying to follow advice from books or the internet. I think that people who are really good at something have too many bits of information in their head about how to do it for that information to really be compressible into a book, let alone a blog post. In sports, good coaches are able to convey that kind of information over time, but I don't know of anything similar for programming, so I think the best thing available for learning rate is to find an environment that's full of experts.
