B - Essentialism

1
- It was like he was majoring in minor activities and as a result, his work became unsatisfying for him and frustrating for the people he was trying so hard to please. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=53))
1
- "Can I actually fulfill this request, given the time and resources I have?” ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=61))
1
- Instead of making just a millimeter of progress in a million directions he began to generate tremendous momentum towards accomplishing the things that were truly vital. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=75))
1
- In this example is the basic value proposition of Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=83))
1
- Dieter’s design criteria can be summarized by a characteristically succinct principle, captured in just three German words: Weniger aber besser. The English translation is: Less but better. A more fitting definition of Essentialism would be hard to come by. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=97))
1
- Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential. The difference between the way of the Essentialist and the way of the Nonessentialist can be seen in the figure opposite. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=105))
1
- The result is that we have the unfulfilling experience of making a millimeter of progress in a million directions. In the image on the right, the energy is given to fewer activities. The result is that by investing in fewer things we have the satisfying experience of making significant progress in the things that matter most. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=111))
1
- The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default. Instead of making choices reactively, the Essentialist deliberately distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many, eliminates the nonessentials, and then removes obstacles so the essential things have clear, smooth passage. In other words, Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=115))
1
- In trying to keep everyone happy I had sacrificed what mattered most. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=147))
1
- If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=148))
1
- “the paradox of success,”2 which can be summed up in four predictable phases: PHASE 1: When we really have clarity of purpose, it enables us to succeed at our endeavor. PHASE 2: When we have success, we gain a reputation as a “go to” person. We become “good old [insert name],” who is always there when you need him, and we are presented with increased options and opportunities. PHASE 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, which is actually code for demands upon our time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts. We get spread thinner and thinner. PHASE 4: We become distracted from what would otherwise be our highest level of contribution. The effect of our success has been to undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=172))
1
- As Peter Drucker said, “In a few hundred years, when the history of our time will be written from a long-term perspective, it is likely that the most important event historians will see is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is an unprecedented change in the human condition. For the first time—literally—substantial and rapidly growing numbers of people have choices. For the first time, they will have to manage themselves. And society is totally unprepared for it.”4 ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=188))
1
- “decision fatigue”: the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates.5 ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=194))
1
- The word priority came into the English language in the 1400s. It was singular. It meant the very first or prior thing. It stayed singular for the next five hundred years. Only in the 1900s did we pluralize the term and start talking about priorities. Illogically, we reasoned that by changing the word we could bend reality. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=208))
1
- Every so often it gets so out of control you try and purge the closet. But unless you have a disciplined system you’ll either end up with as many clothes as you started with because you can’t decide which to give away; end up with regrets because you accidentally gave away clothes you do wear and did want to keep; or end up with a pile of clothes you don’t want to keep but never actually get rid of because you’re not quite sure where to take them or what to do with them. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=225))
1
- Here’s how an Essentialist would approach that closet. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=231))
1
- “Will this activity or effort make the highest possible contribution toward my goal?” ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=236))
1
- “If I didn’t already own this, how much would I spend to buy it?” ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=241))
1
- DISCERNING THE TRIVIAL MANY FROM THE VITAL FEW ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=278))
1
- “What do I feel deeply inspired by?” and “What am I particularly talented at?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?” ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=287))
1
- the right thing the right way at the right time. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=289))
1
- Given the reality of trade-offs, we can’t choose to do everything. The real question is not how can we do it all, it is who will get to choose what we do and don’t do. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=298))
1
- What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives? ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=324))

- Mary Oliver wrote: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?”12 ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=332))
1
- I have observed learned helplessness in many organizations I have worked with. When people believe that their efforts at work don’t matter, they tend to respond in one of two ways. Sometimes they check out and stop trying, like the mathematically challenged child. The other response is less obvious at first. They do the opposite. They become hyperactive. They accept every opportunity presented. They throw themselves into every assignment. They tackle every challenge with gusto. They try to do it all. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=414))
1
- Yet choice is at the very core of what it means to be an Essentialist. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=425))
1
- Yet, for capable people who are already working hard, are there limits to the value of hard work? Is there a point at which doing more does not produce more? Is there a point at which doing less (but thinking more) will actually produce better outcomes? ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=448))
1
- certain types of effort yield higher rewards than others. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=460))
1
- “What is the most valuable result I could achieve in this job?” ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=463))
1
- Richard Koch, ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=484))
1
- According to the power law theory, certain efforts actually produce exponentially more results than others. For example, as Nathan Myhrvold, the ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=493))
1
- An Essentialist, in other words, discerns more so he can do less. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=506))
1
- straddling means keeping your existing strategy intact while simultaneously also trying to adopt the strategy of a competitor. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=539))
1
- ignoring the reality of trade-offs is a terrible strategy for organizations. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=550))
1
- we can either make the hard choices for ourselves or allow others—whether our colleagues, our boss, or our customers—to decide for us. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=565))
1
- Fortunately for them they had the Credo: a statement written in 1943 by then chairman Robert Wood Johnson that is literally carved in stone at Johnson & Johnson headquarters.6 Unlike most corporate mission statements, the Credo actually lists the constituents of the company in priority order. Customers are first; shareholders are last. As a result, Johnson & Johnson swiftly decided to recall all Tylenol, even though it would have a massive impact (to the tune of $100 million, according to some reports) on their bottom line. The safety of customers or $100 million? Not an easy decision. But the Credo enabled a clearer sense of what was most essential. It enabled the tough trade-off to be made. We ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=579))
1
- Essentialists ask the tougher but ultimately more liberating question, “Which problem do I want?” An Essentialist makes trade-offs deliberately. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=596))
1
- inherent part of life, not as an inherently negative part of life. Instead of asking, “What do I have to give up?” they ask, “What do I want to go big on?” ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=615))
1
- What I am suggesting is that when faced with a decision where one option prioritizes family and another prioritizes friends, health, or work, we need to be prepared to ask, “Which problem do you want?” ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=626))
1
- To discern what is truly essential we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=638))
1
- Newton was asked how he had discovered the law of universal gravitation. ‘By thinking on it continually’ was the reply.… What he thought on, he thought on continually, which is to say exclusively, or nearly exclusively.” ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=708))
1
- In every set of facts, something essential is hidden. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=780))
1
- In other words, the nose gear didn’t cause the disaster. The crew’s losing sight of the bigger problem—the altitude of the plane—did. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=795))
1
- “Actually I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.” ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=812))
1
- As a result they may, using a metaphor from C. S. Lewis, run around with fire extinguishers in times of flood. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=816))
1
- Play, which I would define as anything we do simply for the joy of doing rather than as a means to an end—whether it’s flying a kite or listening to music or throwing around a baseball—might seem like a nonessential activity. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=905))
1
- “Play,” he says, “leads to brain plasticity, adaptability, and creativity.” As he succinctly puts it, “Nothing fires up the brain like play.” ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=909))
1
- Bob Fagan, a researcher who has spent fifteen years studying the behavior of grizzly bears, discovered bears who played the most tended to survive the longest. When asked why, he said, “In a world continuously presenting unique challenges and ambiguity, play prepares these bears for a changing planet.” ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=915))
1
- First, play broadens the range of options available to us. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=926))
1
- Second, play is an antidote to stress, and this is key because stress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive, exploratory parts of our brain. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=931))
1
- Recent findings suggest this is because stress increases the activity in the part of the brain that monitors emotions (the amygdala), while reducing the activity in the part responsible for cognitive function (the hippocampus)7—the result being, simply, that we really can’t think clearly. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=933))
1
- Third, as Edward M. Hallowell, a psychiatrist who specializes in brain science, explains, play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain. “The brain’s executive functions,” he writes, “include planning, prioritizing, scheduling, anticipating, delegating, deciding, analyzing—in short, most of the skills any executive must master in order to excel in business.” ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=938))
1
- One of the most common ways people—especially ambitious, successful people—damage this asset is through a lack of sleep. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1006))
1
- Essentialists choose to do one fewer thing right now in order to do more tomorrow. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1034))
1
- These executives are quoted in an article called “Sleep Is the New Status Symbol for Successful Entrepreneurs.” ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1081))

- “If the answer isn’t a definite yes then it should be a no.” ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1119))
2
    - Note: Speaking oppurtunities? Need to say yes based on the topic
1
- you evaluate an option, think about the single most important criterion for that decision, and then simply give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than 90 percent, then automatically change the rating to 0 and simply reject it. This way you avoid getting caught up in indecision, or worse, getting stuck with the 60s or 70s. ([Location 1136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1136))
1
- assigning simple numerical values to our options forces us to make decisions consciously, logically, and rationally, rather than impulsively or emotionally. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1146))
1
- If it isn’t a clear yes, then it’s a clear no. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1191))
1
- But if we just say yes because it is an easy reward, we run the risk of having to later say no to a more meaningful one. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1208))
1
- First, write down the opportunity. Second, write down a list of three “minimum criteria” the options would need to “pass” in order to be considered. Third, write down a list of three ideal or “extreme criteria” the options would need to “pass” in order to be considered. By definition, if the opportunity doesn’t pass the first set of criteria, the answer is obviously no. But if it also doesn’t pass two of your three extreme criteria, the answer is still no. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1219))

- “What am I deeply passionate about?” and “What taps my talent?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?” ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1229))
1
- to inspire their employees with a clear sense of purpose. ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1283))
1
- When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration. When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1298))
1
- “The crime which bankrupts men and states is that of job-work;—declining from your main design to serve a turn here or there.” ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1324))
1
- Done right, an essential intent is one decision that settles one thousand later decisions. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1338))
1
- “If we could be truly excellent at only one thing, what would it be?” ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1360))
1
- Brad Pitt, who, appalled by the lack of progress in rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, had started an organization called “Make It Right” with the essential intent “to build 150 affordable, green, storm-resistant homes for families living in the Lower 9th Ward.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1371))
1
- They distract us from the reality of the fact that either we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say yes and regret it for days, weeks, months, or even years. ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1449))
1
- am greatly honored and flattered by your kind letter of February 14th—for I have admired you and your work for many years, and I have learned much from it. But, my dear Professor Csikszentmihalyi, I am afraid I have to disappoint you. I could not possibly answer your questions. I am told I am creative—I don’t know what that means.… I just keep on plodding.… I hope you will not think me presumptuous or rude if I say that one of the secrets of productivity (in which I believe whereas I do not believe in creativity) is to have a VERY BIG waste paper basket to take care of ALL invitations such as yours—productivity in my experience consists of NOT doing anything that helps the work of other people but to spend all one’s time on the work the Good Lord has fitted one to do, and to do well.” ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1456))
1
- So how do we learn to say no gracefully? Below are general guidelines followed by ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1471))
1
- SEPARATE THE DECISION FROM THE RELATIONSHIP ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1472))
1
- SAYING “NO” GRACEFULLY DOESN’T HAVE TO MEAN USING THE WORD NO ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1476))
1
- FOCUS ON THE TRADE-OFF ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1481))
1
- REMIND YOURSELF THAT EVERYONE IS SELLING SOMETHING ([Location 1485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1485))
1
- I am simply saying everyone is selling something—an idea, a viewpoint, an opinion—in exchange for your time. Simply being aware of what is being sold allows us to be more deliberate in deciding whether we want to buy it. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1486))
1
- MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE FACT THAT SAYING “NO” OFTEN REQUIRES TRADING POPULARITY FOR RESPECT ([Location 1488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1488))
1
- Essentialists accept they cannot be popular with everyone all of the time. ([Location 1501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1501))
1
- REMEMBER THAT A CLEAR “NO” CAN BE MORE GRACEFUL THAN A VAGUE OR NONCOMMITTAL “YES” ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1503))
1
- Being vague is not the same as being graceful, and delaying the eventual “no” will only make it that much harder—and the recipient that much more resentful. ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1506))
1
- continue to invest time, money, or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have already incurred, or sunk, a cost that cannot be recouped. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1572))
1
- “If I did not have this opportunity, how much would I be willing to sacrifice in order to obtain it?” ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1614))
1
- Only when we admit we have made a mistake in committing to something can we make a mistake a part of our past. ([Location 1631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1631))
1
- Someone who is not emotionally involved in the situation and unaffected by the choice we make can give us the permission to stop forcing something that is clearly not working out. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1642))
1
- Simply apologize and tell the person that when you made the commitment you didn’t fully realize what it would entail. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1670))
1
- In a reverse pilot you test whether removing an initiative or activity will have any negative consequences. ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1678))

- What I mean is that a good editor is someone who uses deliberate subtraction to actually add life ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1719))
1
- The Latin root of the word decision—cis or cid—literally means “to cut” or “to kill.” ([Location 1741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1741))
1
- As Alan D. Williams observed in the essay “What Is an Editor?” there are “two basic questions the editor should be addressing to the author: Are you saying what you want to say? and, Are you saying it as clearly and concisely as possible?”7 Condensing means saying it as clearly and concisely as possible. ([Location 1751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1751))
1
- It means lowering the ratio of words to ideas, square feet to usefulness, or effort to results. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1761))
1
- When we are added onto an e-mail thread, for example, we can resist our usual temptation to be the first to reply all. When sitting in a meeting, we can resist the urge to add our two cents. We can wait. We can observe. We can see how things develop. Doing less is not just a powerful Essentialist strategy, it’s a powerful editorial one as well.

- “Most creative individuals find out early what their best rhythms are for sleeping, eating, and working, and abide by them even when it is tempting to do otherwise,” Mihaly says. “They wear clothes that are comfortable, they interact only with people they find congenial, they do only things they think are important. Of course, such idiosyncrasies are not endearing to those they have to deal with.… But personalizing patterns of action helps to free the mind from the expectations that make demands on attention and allows intense concentration on matters that count.” ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2312))

Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular habit is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop—cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward—becomes more automatic as the cue and reward become neurologically intertwined.”8 ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=2337))

- MIND-SET Nonessentialist Everything to everyone Essentialist Less but better TALENT Nonessentialist Hires people frantically and creates a “Bozo explosion.” Essentialist Ridiculously selective on talent and removes people who hold the team back. STRATEGY Nonessentialist Pursues a straddled strategy where everything is a priority. Essentialist Defines an essential intent by answering the question, “If we could only do one thing, what would it be?” Eliminates the nonessential distractions. EMPOWERMENT Nonessentialist Allows ambiguity over who is doing what. Decisions are capricious. Essentialist Focuses on each team member’s highest role and goal of contribution. COMMUNICATION Nonessentialist Talks in code. Essentialist Listens to get to what is essential. ACCOUNTABILITY Nonessentialist Checks in too much or is so busy he or she checks out altogether. Sometimes does both: disrupting the focus of the group and then being absent to the group. Essentialist Checks in with people in a gentle way to see how he or she can remove obstacles and enable small wins. RESULT Nonessentialist A fractured team that makes a millimeter of progress in a million directions Essentialist A unified team that breaks through to the next level of contribution From looking at this chart, the advantages of applying the Essentialist approach to every aspect of leadership that matters should be clear. Still, let’s take a moment to briefly expand on these to get even clearer on how, exactly, to lead as an Essentialist.
