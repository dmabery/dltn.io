A - If you want to be a writer, you have to be a reader first

- You can’t be a good writer without being a devoted reader.”

- If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut… If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time or the tools to write.” 
  —[Stephen King](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439156816?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwaustinkleo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1439156816) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2k45a07pthnsez72y4zfwdk))

- If you stuff yourself full of poems, essays, plays, stories, novels, films, comic strips, magazines, music, you automatically explode every morning like Old Faithful. I have never had a dry spell in my life, mainly because I feed myself well, to the point of bursting.” 
  —Ray Bradbury ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2k46wj9t9k91kn30wy99asv))

- If only you’d remember before you ever sit down to write that you’ve been a reader much longer than you were ever a writer. You simply fix that fact in your mind, then sit very still and ask yourself, as a reader, what piece of writing in all the world [you] would most want to read…”
