- I actually have a notecard on my desk that’s another Ryan phrase. It says, “Discipline now, freedom later.” I think about that even when I’m getting back from a run and don’t feel like untying my shoes. The discipline now will pay off later. I look at that notecard and think I could be loosy-goosy and procrastinate and let things go, but I try to make just a little progress every day on things and then I feel good about it. If I feel like I throw a day away, I’m sort of kicking myself. I want to avoid that.
  It’s not time blocked. It’s just bullet points of my four main projects. A lot of what I work on isn’t due tomorrow. The deadline for this is two months away, so I do napkin math at the start like, “If I do this amount of work on this each day, I’ll come in well ahead of the deadline.” I know if I make this amount of progress, I’m in a good spot.
