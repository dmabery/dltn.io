A - A Blog Post Is a Very Long and Complex Search Query to Find Fascinating People and Make Them Route Interesting Stuff to Your Inbox

1
- The more precise and niche the words I input, the better the internet would match me with people I could forge meaningful relationships with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp25fd7dam3r9ewe6d9vppr))
1
- Any which way, by pursuing your interest, you will move toward complexity. The simple things do not surprise you anymore. So you turn your attention to more complicated things. This is an amazing algorithm: do interesting things and magically arrive at a complex understanding of the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp28f1zfaqwc8bxyzx1d10v))

- The reason I’m spelling out this dynamic is twofold. First, you *can* get out of this mess if you want to. You do that by writing online (or publishing cool pieces of software, or videos, or whatever makes you tickle—as long as you work in public). Second, if you want to get out of the mess the key lies exactly in understanding that you are not the only person who has no one to talk to about the things you get obsessed by.

- Clear writing is clear thinking. But to make the content accessible? To cut digressions and obscure references to reduce the number of things people need to understand to make sense of your argument? Really? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp2bwg6bmrmpyptb59ep5jp))
1
- You ask yourself: What would have made me jump off my chair if I had read it six months ago (or a week ago, or however fast you write)? If you have figured out something that made you ecstatic, this is what you should write. And you do not dumb it down, because you were not stupid six months ago, you just knew less. You also write with as much useful detail and beauty as you can muster, because that is what you would have wanted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp2ddfavkmgt1pxkm59ka1b))

- Six months ago, I was thinking about how large language models will affect how we learn. The essay [Using GPT-3 to augment human learning](https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/gpt-3) would have made me jump off my chair and run out to Johanna talking excitedly and incomprehensibly; that’s why I wrote it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp2dty3chg9z3s2xxajsr0z))

    - Note: Interesting idea. When there is a new social trend, what essay title would make me click “I need to read that” and what would be inside of that to make it worthwhile? What would I actually want to read inside that piece?
      Those are the things I need to start writing about, and thinking about in the mornings.
1
- I also made the essay a bit literary and flamboyant, which you are not “supposed” to do when writing about AI, at least not if you want the average LessWrong reader to upvote it. I’m not the average Less Wrong reader; I much prefer Thomas Bernhard’s rants to Eliezer Yudkowsky’s. Hence, I made it flamboyant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp2h6dvwr7fb6gnv23eh4yk))

- I’m not saying it was a great essay; I’m saying *I* would have loved it. The essay would have answered most of the questions I had, and it would have given me a new more complex understanding of language models that I could have used to get excited by even more obscure things. And because the internet is big, there were a few thousand people who felt the same way—and I felt really deeply for these people.

    - Note: Good heuristic for writing. What questions would I have liked answered in a piece? 
      One idea is the company-based creator. What would I want to read about an essay like that?
1
- It is crazy-beautiful to have a stranger arrive in your inbox, and they are excited by exactly the same things as you! You start dropping the most obscure references, and they’re like, yeah, read that, love it. The first handful of times it happened, Johanna asked me what was wrong. I was crying in the kitchen.
  Those were tears of homecoming. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp2jz2kswdg3300qxq109nw))

    - Note: I’ve yet to feel this, but boy do I hope so one day.

- If you follow the advice above, you will write essays that almost no one likes.
  Luckily, *almost no one* multiplied by the entire population of the internet is plenty if you can only find them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsp4kh02h1jtgmwrvvpzwpm9))

- The trick, then, is this. You take the person you think is closest to the person (or type of person) you want to talk to and send what you write to this person. A subreddit is a good place to start. I usually do this by collecting interesting people on Twitter through good reply game.
