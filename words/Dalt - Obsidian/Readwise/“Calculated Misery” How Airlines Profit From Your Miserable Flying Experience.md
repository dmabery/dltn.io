A - “Calculated Misery”: How Airlines Profit From Your Miserable Flying Experience

1
- The person who coined the phrase “calculated misery” is a man named [Tim Wu](https://twitter.com/superwuster), a professor at Columbia Law school, an author, and a contributing writer at the New Yorker. His expertise covers topics like net neutrality theory and antitrust law — topics that aren’t far removed from his observations about the airline industry.
  In 2014, Wu wrote an article for the New Yorker about the decline in quality of commercial airline service. In his eyes, there was an unspoken agreement among the country’s biggest airlines to make the flying experience terrible no matter what airline you fly. [Wu wrote](http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/airlines-want-you-to-suffer):
  > Here’s the thing: in order for fees to work, there needs be something worth paying to avoid. That necessitates, at some level, a strategy that can be described as “calculated misery.” Basic service, without fees, must be sufficiently degraded in order to make people want to pay to escape it. And that’s where the suffering begins. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrt2pgt38ke4vtn1zs8d6y8c))

- Wu believes “calculated misery” also includes things that might not strike us as outright cash grabs. One of the examples he cites is the inefficient way planes board. Studies have shown that boarding in a random order is faster than the methods many airlines currently use, but that hasn’t inspired those airlines to change their ways.

  The thinking is that if boarding were more efficient and less stressful, there wouldn’t be any incentive for people to pay that priority boarding fee. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrt2tt8ccxwxc40g6qm74ypa))
