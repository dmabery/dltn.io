B - The Psychology of Money

1
- “A genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.” —Napoleon “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.” —Sherlock Holmes ([Location 24](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=24))
1
- The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=41))
1
- A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence. ([Location 42](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=42))
1
- financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=80))
1
- To grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need to study interest rates; you need to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. To get why investors sell out at the bottom of a bear market you don’t need to study the math of expected future returns; you need to think about the agony of looking at your family and wondering if your investments are imperiling their future. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=112))
1
- “History never repeats itself; man always does.” It applies so well to how we behave with money. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=115))
1
- Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and plugging it into their unique mental model of how the world works. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=203))
1
- But every financial decision a person makes, makes sense to them in that moment and checks the boxes they need to check. They tell themselves a story about what they’re doing and why they’re doing it, and that story has been shaped by their own unique experiences. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=207))
1
- Few people make financial decisions purely with a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a company meeting. Places where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works for you. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=224))
1
- the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=306))
1
- Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=379))
1
- Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=385))
1
- Bill Gates once said, “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.” ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=397))
1
- Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=400))
1
- 1. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=467))
1
- The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with—to accept that you might have enough, even if it’s less than those around you. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=482))
1
- Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable. And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=502))
1
- His skill is investing, but his secret is time. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=556))
1
- But good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=593))
1
- Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=633))
1
- Warren, Charlie, and Rick made investments together and interviewed business managers together. Then Rick kind of disappeared, at least relative to Buffett and Munger’s success. Investor Mohnish Pabrai once asked Buffett what happened to Rick. Mohnish recalled: [Warren said] “Charlie and I always knew that we would become incredibly wealthy. We were not in a hurry to get wealthy; we knew it would happen. Rick was just as smart as us, but he was in a hurry.” What happened was that in the 1973–1974 downturn, Rick was levered with margin loans. And the stock market went down almost 70% in those two years, so he got margin calls. He sold his Berkshire stock to Warren—Warren actually said “I bought Rick’s Berkshire stock”—at under $40 a piece. Rick was forced to sell because he was levered.

    - Note: Story]]
1
- Nassim Taleb put it this way: “Having an ‘edge’ and surviving are two different things: the first requires the second. You need to avoid ruin. At ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=675))
1
- 2. Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=686))
1
- It’s different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=699))
1
- Destruction in the face of progress is not only possible, but an efficient way to get rid of excess. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=710))
1
- He associated good times with the end of bad times. Getting wealthy made him feel like staying wealthy was inevitable, and that he was invincible. After losing nearly everything he reflected: ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=730))
1
- Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=754))
1
- Anything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the result of a tail event—an outlying one-in-thousands or millions event. And ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=765))
1
- “The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.” ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=809))
1
- “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=869))
1
- Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=885))
1
- But doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing something you hate. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=905))
1
- A wise old owl lived in an oak, The more he saw the less he spoke, The less he spoke, the more he heard, Why aren’t we all like that wise old bird? ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=938))
1
- Savings can be created by spending less. You can spend less if you desire less. And you will desire less if you care less about what others think of you. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1101))
1
- Saving is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1108))
1
- Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1114))
1
- Intelligence is not a reliable advantage in a world that’s become as connected as ours has. ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1135))
1
- A rational investor makes decisions based on numeric facts. A reasonable investor makes them in a conference room surrounded by co-workers you want to think highly of you, with a spouse you don’t want to let down, or judged against the silly but realistic competitors that are your brother-in-law, your neighbor, and your own personal doubts. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1196))
1
- What’s often overlooked in finance is that something can be technically true but contextually nonsense. ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1205))
1
- There are few financial variables more correlated to performance than commitment to a strategy during its lean years—both the amount of performance and the odds of capturing it over a given period of time. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1221))
1
- The historical odds of making money in U.S. markets are 50/50 over one-day periods, 68% in one-year periods, 88% in 10-year periods, and (so far) 100% in 20-year periods. Anything that keeps you in the game has a quantifiable advantage. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1223))
1
- Invest in a promising company you don’t care about, and you might enjoy it when everything’s going well. But when the tide inevitably turns you’re suddenly losing money on something you’re not interested in. It’s a double burden, and the path of least resistance is to move onto something else. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1227))
1
- “Things that have never happened before happen all the time.” History is mostly the study of surprising events. But it is often used by investors and economists as an unassailable guide to the future. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1250))
1
- A trap many investors fall into is what I call “historians as prophets” fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1254))
1
- Experiencing specific events does not necessarily qualify you to know what will happen next. In fact it rarely does, because experience leads to overconfidence more than forecasting ability. ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1268))
1
- In Pharaonic Egypt … scribes tracked the high-water mark of the Nile and used it as an estimate for a future worst-case scenario. The same can be seen in the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which experienced a catastrophic failure in 2011 when a tsunami struck. It had been built to withstand the worst past historical earthquake, with the builders not imagining much worse—and not thinking that the worst past event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent. ([Location 1311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1311))
1
- The odds are in your favor when playing Russian roulette. But the downside is not worth the potential upside. There is no margin of safety that can compensate for the risk. ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1473))
1
- The ability to do what you want, when you want, for as long as you want, has an infinite ROI. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1486))
1
- But these kinds of things happen all the time. You can plan for every risk except the things that are too crazy to cross your mind. ([Location 1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1496))
1
- A good rule of thumb for a lot of things in life is that everything that can break will eventually break. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1512))
1
- The biggest single point of failure with money is a sole reliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, with no savings to create a gap between what you think your expenses are and what they might be in the future. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1518))
1
- In fact, the most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan. ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1524))
1
- An underpinning of psychology is that people are poor forecasters of their future selves. ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1537))
1
- The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires, and goals are likely to change in the future. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1555))
1
- But there are two things to keep in mind when making what you think are long-term decisions. We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1575))
1
- Aiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderate annual savings, moderate free time, no more than a moderate commute, and at least moderate time with your family, increases the odds of being able to stick with a plan and avoid regret than if any one of those things fall to the extreme sides of the spectrum. ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1584))

    - Note: Too little income and you cant retife. Too much abd you regret working all those years soo har. Solutkon. Stay in the middle
1
- We should also come to accept the reality of changing our minds. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1586))
1
- When you accept the End of History Illusion, you realize that the odds of picking a job when you’re not old enough to drink that you will still enjoy when you’re old enough to qualify for Social Security are low. ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1588))
1
- Responding to critics who said his actions were wrong and what he should have done was obvious, Immelt told his successor, “Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.” Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it because the challenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to those in the crowd. ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1614))
1
- Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret—all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time. ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1625))
1
- The worthwhile tradeoff of fees is obvious when it’s clear you’re paying one. ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1684))
1
- An iron rule of finance is that money chases returns to the greatest extent that it can. If an asset has momentum—it’s been moving consistently up for a period of time—it’s not crazy for a group of short-term traders to assume it will keep moving up. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1725))
1
- Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1728))
1
- It’s hard to justify paying $700,000 for a two-bedroom Florida tract home to raise your family in for the next 10 years. But it makes perfect sense if you plan on flipping the home in a few months into a market with rising prices to make a quick profit. Which is exactly what many people were doing during the bubble. ([Location 1741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1741))
1
- Bubbles do their damage when long-term investors playing one game start taking their cues from those short-term traders playing another. ([Location 1757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1757))
1
- Many finance and investment decisions are rooted in watching what other people do and either copying them or betting against them. ([Location 1767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1767))
1
- A young lawyer aiming to be a partner at a prestigious law firm might need to maintain an appearance that I, a writer who can work in sweatpants, have no need for. But when his purchases set my own expectations, I’m wandering down a path of potential disappointment because I’m spending the money without the career boost he’s getting. ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1779))
1
- A takeaway here is that few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing different games than you are. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1783))
1
- How I invest my own money is detailed in chapter 20, but years ago I wrote out “I am a passive investor optimistic in the world’s ability to generate real economic growth and I’m confident that over the next 30 years that growth will accrue to my investments.” ([Location 1787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1787))
1
- Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1798))
1
- There is an iron law in economics: extremely good and extremely bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long because supply and demand adapt in hard-to-predict ways. ([Location 1884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1884))
1
- Threats incentivize solutions in equal magnitude. That’s a common plot of economic history that is too easily forgotten by pessimists who forecast in straight lines. ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1900))
1
- Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant. ([Location 1927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1927))
1
- It’s easier to create a narrative around pessimism because the story pieces tend to be fresher and more recent. Optimistic narratives require looking at a long stretch of history and developments, which people tend to forget and take more effort to piece together. ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1929))
1
- Expecting things to be bad is the best way to be pleasantly surprised when they’re not. ([Location 1950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1950))
1
- Daniel Kahneman once told me about the stories people tell themselves to make sense of the past. He said: Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields. ([Location 2065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2065))
1
- Coming to terms with how much you don’t know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control. ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2077))
1
- Psychologist Philip Tetlock once wrote: “We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.” ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2084))
1
- To what extent will the outcome of your effort depend on what you do in your firm? This is evidently an easy question; the answer comes quickly and it has never been less than 80%. Even when they are not sure they will succeed, these bold people think their fate is almost entirely in their own hands. They are surely wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends as much on the achievements of its competitors and on changes in the market as on its own efforts. However, entrepreneurs naturally focus on what they know best—their plans and actions and the most immediate threats and opportunities, such as the availability of funding. They know less about their competitors and therefore find it natural to imagine a future in which the competition plays little part. ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2104))
1
- Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or more options in the future. ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2153))
1
- Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance. ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2167))
1
- Independence, at any income level, is driven by your savings rate. And past a certain level of income your savings rate is driven by your ability to keep your lifestyle expectations from running away. ([Location 2224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2224))
1
- I can afford to not be the greatest investor in the world, but I can’t afford to be a bad one. ([Location 2279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2279))
1
- It doesn’t need to be more complicated than that for us. I like it simple. One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there is little correlation between investment effort and investment results. The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a few variables account for the majority of returns. ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2285))
