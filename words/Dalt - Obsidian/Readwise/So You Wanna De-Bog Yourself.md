A - So You Wanna De-Bog Yourself

1
- They’re looking for advice less in the sense of “any good restaurants around here?” and more in the sense of “everything kinda sucks right now and I’d like to change that but I don’t know how?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38b1mka65cs7kxj7mss46xg))
1
- the forces that keep you in the bog are always the same. There are, in fact, only three, although they each come in a variety of foul flavors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38b2tgrfrr2zbywtzq9j1kg))

- ***Gutterballing***
  People will sometimes approach me with projects I don't really want to do. But if I do them, those people will smile and shake my hand and go, “We feel positive emotions, and it's because of you!” and that will feel good. So I often end up signing on to these projects, feeling resentful the whole time, cursing myself for choosing—freely!—to work hard on things I don't care about.
  This is *gutterballing*: excelling, but in slightly the wrong direction. For most of its journey, after all, the gutterball is getting closer to the pins. It's only at the end that it barely, but dramatically, misses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38b4h58rjswxppmwf38k58k))

- ***Waiting for jackpot***
  Sometimes when I'm stuck, someone will be like, “Why don't you do [reasonable option]?” and I'll go, “Hold on there, buddy! Don't you see this option has *downsides*? Find me one with only upsides, and then we'll talk!”
  I'm *waiting for jackpot*, refusing to do anything until an option arises that dominates all other options on all dimensions. Strangely, this never seems to happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38b56rc221hdr9s4reebhf7))
1
- When I put off doing the brave thing, I am *declining the dragon*: missing an opportunity to do something that might be scary in the moment but would ultimately make me feel great. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38b72f5b7jf162ny7vrepet))

- ***The mediocrity trap***
  About half of my friends *kind of* hate their jobs, so they're moderately unhappy most of the time, but never unhappy enough to leave. This is the *mediocrity trap*: situations that are bad-but-not-too-bad keep you forever in their orbit because they never inspire the frustration it takes to achieve escape velocity.

- ***Stroking the problem***
  I spend a lot of time thinking about my problems, but it usually looks like this:
  “Oh boy, what a problem! A real whopper, I'd say. Massive, even. Get a load of this problem, would ya! Wowzers!” I can spend *days* doing this. “How big would you say that problem is? Large? Huge? And that's just its size! Don't get me started on its depth.”
  This isn't solving the problem; this is *stroking* the problem. It looks like a good use of time, but it's just a form of [socially acceptable anxiety](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/socially-acceptable-anxiety-is-still), a way to continue your suffering indefinitely by becoming obsessed with it.

    - Note: Before this was different ways of keeping yourself stuck. What follows are bad ways of trying to get unstuck.
1
- This is the *try harder fallacy*. I behold my situation and conclude that, somehow, I will improve it in the future by just sort of wishing it to be different ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38b9ywgw5scm5y01vm4r18k))
1
- ***The infinite effort illusion***
  The *try harder fallacy* has a cousin called the *infinite effort illusion*, which is the idea that you have this secret unused stock of effort that you can deploy in the future to get yourself unstuck. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bbhs66ynhc1etqwnepj3f))
1
- This is *blaming God*: pinning the responsibility for my current predicament on something utterly unchangeable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bcd41s2kpzzfczv2tqc2b))
1
- ***Diploma problems and toothbrushing problems***
  Some problems are like getting a diploma: you work at it for a while, and then you're done forever. Learning how to ride a bike is a classic *diploma problem*.
  But most problems aren’t like that. They’re more like *toothbrushing problems*: you have to work at them forever until you die. You can’t, as far as I know, just brush your teeth really really well and then let ‘em ride forever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bdfe8cm31wqmgcxqc8z7j))

- ***Puppeteering***
  People are always causing me problems by doing foolish things like trying to drive on highways while I'm also trying to drive on them, or expecting me to pay rent every month, or not realizing my genius and putting me in charge of things. In these cases, it feels like the only solution is to get other people to act differently. I'm only stuck because other people are unreasonable!
  A good word for this is *puppeteering*: trying to solve your problems by controlling the actions of other humans. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bf3hsp2d0t4x5wnwmbvkg))

- A confession: most of my bogs are imaginary. The world doesn’t stick me there; *I* stick me there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bfs6vm8p8kzhjz5yyeyg7))

- ***Floor is lava***
  Every kid learns to play the “floor is lava” game, where you pretend that you'll get incinerated if you touch the carpet. Even toddlers can pick it up, which reveals something profound: very early on, we acquire the ability to pretend that fake problems are real. We then spend the rest of our lives doing exactly that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bg3e9ke2xjk32ym7wzkpn))
1
- I now think of this as *super surveillance*, tracking every problem in the world as if they were all somehow, ultimately, my problems. Super surveillance is an express ticket to the bog, because the world is full of problems and you'd be lucky to solve even a single one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bh2ahh21fjkawny6ms2dr))
1
- ***Hedgehogging***
  Sometimes I get this feeling like, “Nothing will ever work out for me, I will always be unhappy, the rest of my life will be a sort of wandering twilight punctuated with periods of misery.”
  And my wife will go, “You're hungry.”
  And I'll go, “No, no, this is true unhappiness, it comes to me unadulterated from hell itself, it lives inside my bones, I am persecuted by God, you could not possibly know what it's like to be me.”
  And then I'll eat a burrito and be like, “Never mind I'm fine!”
  This is *hedgehogging*: refusing to be influenced by others, even when you should. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bhzsngt526z84tvzrszdj))
1
- This is *obsessing over tiny predictors*. It's scary to admit that you can't control the future; it's a lot easier to distract yourself by trying to optimize every decision, no matter how insignificant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j38bmq9bfhkwj2vd8q0y2xr4))
