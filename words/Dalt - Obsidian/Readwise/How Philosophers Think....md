- How Philosophers Think
  Philosophers are the best thinkers I know, and their tactics can help us all. 
  Here are my favorite ones:
  1. Be an intellectual boxer: Understand ideas by making them battle with each other. Create characters in your mind and make them debate each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1400119165390929926))

- 2. Dissect ideas
  The smartest kid in my middle school class used to take computers apart and put them back together again in order to understand how they work. 
  Good philosophers are like my friend from middle school. But instead of playing with computers, they play with ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1400119166791737346))

- 3. Think by writing
  Deep thinking happens by writing, which allows us to navigate the hazy labyrinth of consciousness.
  Most roads lead to a dead end. But every now and then, the compass of intuition leads to an epiphany that the top-down planning mind would’ve never discovered.

- 4. Respect the context
  You understand an idea not when you’ve memorized it, but when you know why its form was chosen over the alternatives. Only once you’ve traveled the roads that were explored but rejected can you see an idea clearly, with all the context that supports it.

- 5. Writing is more than typing
  Most of the time a philosopher spends writing doesn’t involve typing. 
  Rather, it’s a form of intellectual exploration — following intellectual embryos and running into various roadblocks on their way to discovering an idea’s mature form. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1400119175780110336))

- 6. Ideas are like fashion
  Since ideas are invisible, people underestimate the extent to which they can arbitrarily go in and out of style. We laugh at the things people in the 70s used to wear, but if we could see ideas in photos, we’d do the same for our thinking.

- 7. Copy-cat thinking is everywhere
  People who don’t have the tools to reason independently make up their minds by adopting the opinions of prestigious people. When they do, they favor socially rewarded positions over objective accounts of reality.

- 8. Beware of the Spotlight Effect
  By definition, we’re blind to what we can’t see. When looking for answers, we’re like the proverbial drunk who only looks for their keys in places where the light is shining. That’s why philosophers study both the ground and the spotlight. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1400119191127085056))

- 9. Live with Intellectual Grace
  Philosophy, like regular life, is best experienced with an attitude of intellectual grace. 
  “What can this person teach me?” is a much more productive question than “How is this person wrong?” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1400119192423223297))

- 10. Intellectual patience
  People leap to conclusions because they feel pressure to have an opinion on every topic. They jump on the intellectual bandwagons of those they want to be affiliated with. But favoring group loyalty over independent reasoning is the epitome of tribalism ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1400119193937317888))

- 11. Human nature doesn't change
  Even if history is an unceasing sprint toward the future, human nature doesn’t change. Only the laws of physics are more predictable. What’s happened in the past will happen in the future — again, again, and again. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1400119195254276100))
