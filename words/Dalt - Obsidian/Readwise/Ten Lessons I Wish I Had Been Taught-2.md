- German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel wrote that any philosopher who uses the word “and” too often cannot be a good philosopher. I think he was right, at least insofar as lecturing goes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hekretjsxrqwp10srqrt9hq7))

- c. Relate to your audience.
  As you enter the lecture hall, try to spot someone in the audience with whose work you have some familiarity. Quickly rearrange your presentation so as to manage to mention some of that person’s work.

This scenario occurred more than once, and I was eventually forced to reconsider my publishing standards in phenomenology.
  It so happens that the fundamental treatises of phenomenology are written in thick, heavy, philosophical German. Tradition demands that no examples ever be given of what one is talking about. One day I decided, not without serious misgivings, to publish a paper that was es24 NOTICES OF THE AMS
