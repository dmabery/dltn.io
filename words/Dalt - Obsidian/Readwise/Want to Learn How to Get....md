  Psychologist 'human lie detector' Paul Ekman has these 5 tips:
  👇
1
- 1) Look for 'emotional leakage' to detect a lie
  Emotional leakage occurs when our body language, hand gestures & facial expressions betray us
  “Look for discrepancies. The speech doesn’t fit the voice, the voice doesn’t fit w/ the face & body movements don’t fit w/ any of them.”

- 2) Avoid Othello's error
  "Othello’s error" alludes to the Shakespearean play in which Othello falsely believes that his wife has been cheating on him. 
  “Emotions do not tell you their trigger. You could know how someone's feeling, but you don't know *what* triggered it.”

- 3) Learn the basic emotional triggers
  Ekman's research indicates there are 5 broad categories of emotions & that each of them has a subset of emotional states
  Take a look at the Atlas of Emotions & learn how to gain control over your emotional triggers.

- 4) Your counterpart’s face is a mirror to your own.
  “You can’t see your own face, but you can see theirs." 
  If you detect disappointment, fear, or sadness in your partner’s face, you can become aware of how you’re acting and whether you’re inflicting harm on the other party.

- 5) Pay attention to micro-expressions
  "The truth is written on all of our faces."
  Ekman's research inspired the TV series “Lie to Me,” & he taught the cast about deception detection.
