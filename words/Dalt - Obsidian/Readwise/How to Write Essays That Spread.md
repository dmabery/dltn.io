A - How to Write Essays That Spread

1
- Every article has **thrust** and **drag**. The thrust of a piece is what motivates readers to invest the energy necessary to extract its meaning. It is the reason they click. Drag is everything that makes the reader’s task harder, such as meandering intros, convoluted sentences, abstruse locution and even little things like a missing Oxford comma.

- For this piece, the central question is, “How can I write essays that spread online?” It seems obvious, but it was only something I figured out about halfway through the first draft. When I started writing, all I had was a fuzzy idea that I would write about the frameworks and theories about writing I’ve developed over the past three years. The original placeholder title was “writing advice.” Most essays start this way.
  Once you’ve found the central question, you can go back and re-orient everything you’ve written to provide answers as logically as possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsez2q8d55pz791vxrgg9n28))

    - Note: This one thing I struggle with. What is my central theme or lesson learned from studying the blitz? What about my essay on writing, what should people learn from if?

- Because readers aren’t used to giving feedback, I ask them to look out for anything that triggers the following reactions:
  1. Awesome
  2. Boring

  4. Disagree/don’t believe ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsez7trbwqtsfh58j04tvb5n))

- In retrospect, almost everything I did besides write or edit was a waste of time that cost the company significant momentum. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsezajb0axbcw6t2d2c6ybyk))
