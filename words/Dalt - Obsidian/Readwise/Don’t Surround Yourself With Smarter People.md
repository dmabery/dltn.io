A - Don‚Äôt Surround Yourself With Smarter People

1
- There is an idea that I have been guilty of uncritically parroting and promoting in the past: surround yourself with smarter people. Another popular version is never be the smartest guy in the room.
  Beneath the humblebragging in both versions (your cut-off for smart is a de facto declaration of ‚Äúlook how smart I am; only Einsteins are worthy of surrounding me, and I understand the things they say!‚Äù), there is a basic logical issue: If the smarter people are dumb enough to surround themselves with the likes of you, they are dumber than you, which means they‚Äôre smart and you‚Äôre dumb. Wait. What? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557082299/21396229))

    - Note: üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - what does Godel-level error mean?

- Yet, there seems to be a germ of truth to the idea. My alternative to the heuristic, which many of you have heard in off-blog conversations, is that I am only interested in people as long as they are unpredictable to me. If I can predict what you‚Äôll do or say, I‚Äôll lose interest in you rapidly. If you can keep regularly surprising me in some way, forcing me to actually think in unscripted ways in order to respond, I‚Äôll stay interested.

- We‚Äôre not talking any old kind of surprise, but non sequiturs. Surprises that you can‚Äôt really relate to anything else, and don‚Äôt know what to do with. Mind-expanding surprises rather than gap-closing surprises.
  Huh?! rather than aha! or ooh! ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557082299/21396237))

- This means that swapping pieces has an indeterminate effect. Swapping a queen for a knight almost always makes things worse, but in some small fraction of situations, makes things better. You can‚Äôt know for certain though, unless you specify the situation and compute the resulting change in positional strength. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557082299/21396259))

- Freedom ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557082299/21396292))

- Knowledge: In part this sense of freedom is due to knowledge: you‚Äôre less torn by anxious attachments when you recognize how something must naturally and necessarily unfold. If you fire somebody, they‚Äôre going to be upset, and if you know that ahead of time, you can be all pond-like about it. Knowledge is freedom from getting mad at facts.

- Emotional Self-Management: I like to think of this as accepting the emotions you have instead of having emotions about having emotions in an endless stack. Yeah, the tooth is about to get painfully pulled. Fear. Not fear, plus anxiety about fear, plus guilt about anxiety about fear, plus shame about displaying guilt about experiencing anxiety about having fear. This is emotional focus. Instead of retreating from an emotion through layers of additional emotions until you find one you can deal with, you experience the actual emotion for what it is.

- So philosopher‚Äôs insomnia doesn‚Äôt actually work as a defense mechanism. If you don‚Äôt turn the cultivation of incompetence itself into a game of skill, some other finite game will invariably suck you in. When it comes to insomniac philosophers at least, every finite game is an adverse selection mechanism: it sucks in precisely those insomniac philosophers who are least alive to the fact that it is a game, and therefore most susceptible to falling terminally asleep within it. By definition, the game that sucks you in is the one that you are not on guard against. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557082299/21408195))

- We can finally define what it means for someone to be differently free from you. They are people who are playing just a slightly different game than you are. That difference makes them a reliable sources of non sequiturs in your life. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557082299/21408215))
