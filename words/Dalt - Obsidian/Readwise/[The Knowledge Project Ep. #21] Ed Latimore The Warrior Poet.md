- **Ed:** Yeah man. Social media age, right? We are infected with this, this disease of self-promotion, but we’re not self-promoting what we’ve done, we’re self-promoting what we plan to do. And then we get a bunch of people to go, “Ah, man, good luck, go for it. You go girl,” whatever you see, and your brain, and this is true, there’s a lot of research on this. Your brain goes, “Holy shit, look at all this approval, we must have already did it, why are we going to keep doing work now, we’re going to slack off,” there’s just no benefit of talking about what you’ve done.
  At best case scenario, you do it. Right? Which is what you were trying to do, worst case, you don’t. And if you don’t, now you’ve told all these people that you are going to, but there’s nothing to show.
  So now what do you do? You hope on what they call the dopamine treadmill, you get back on it, you talk about the newest goal. I mean I don’t know, I don’t think I’ve seen you on Facebook at all, but I’m sure there’s some version, [inaudible 00:55:13] … Twitter tends to skew kind of different in terms of the activity that goes on amongst the users. You see every … someone goes, “I’m trying to lose this amount of weight.” Or, “I want to do this.” Or, “I’m going to start this.” And people go, all this bunch of likes and there’s a big rally behind it. And in three months, same shit, they’re in the same spot. Nothing happened, nothing changed. Why? Because they got all the validation in their brain.
  I’m never going to be the guy that says motivation doesn’t count for a thing. And motivation is important. But it’s a finite resource, and it will exhaust itself and when that falls off, you got to rely on maybe habit, system, and necessity, all kinds of things to get you through, but because that system is in place, it can be hijacked. And one of the ways we hijack it is we go, and we get all this false recognition. [inaudible 00:56:10] I’ve gotten a reasonable amount of recognition in my life for things that I have done. I’ll tell you what it feels a lot better and it’s a lot less nerve wracking when a person congratulates a person, and then they can also go look it up independently online and go, “Oh okay, alright.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3cty07qsmg9z0f0t45qqa7c))

    - Note: why you shouldn't talk about what you're going to try or are working on. C.R this to Bob Caro's idea that he gets sick of the project when he talks about what he's working on, so he doesn't talk about it, from Working
