A - A Constitution for Teenage Happiness

- In Alan Bennett’s *[The History Boys](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-History-Boys-play-by-Bennett),* the profoundly human (i.e., imperfect) teacher, Hector, reminds his students that “The best moments in reading are when you come across something—a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things—that you’d thought special, particular to you. And here it is, set down by someone else, a person you’ve never met, maybe even someone long dead. And it’s as if a hand has come out and taken yours.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9ncq5xmsj34xwz7vp3gba1d))

- I used to think speed equaled competence. If you’re a motivated student, you may find yourself on the “accelerated” track. Instead of learning things that challenge you, you are simply rushed through the curriculum, “covering” concepts at a faster rate than your peers. Since I transitioned to homeschool, I never move on from a problem or subject before I am ready. I find knowing that I truly understand something—or at least, have spent time *trying* to know it, thus expanding my mind—far more rewarding than the fleeting frisson of being the first to finish.
