B - Turning the Flywheel

1
- Once you fully grasp how to create flywheel momentum in your particular circumstance (which is the topic of this monograph) and apply that understanding with creativity and discipline, you get the power of strategic compounding. Each turn builds upon previous work as you make a series of good decisions, supremely well executed, that compound one upon another. This is how you build greatness.

- When caught in the doom loop, companies react to disappointing results without discipline—grasping for a new savior, program, fad, event, or direction—only to experience more disappointment. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=46))

- Notice how each component in the Vanguard flywheel isn’t merely a “next action step on a list” but almost an inevitable consequence of the step that came before. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=69))

- The Vanguard case exemplifies a key aspect of how the best flywheels work. If you nail one component, you’re propelled into the next component, and the next, and the next, and the next—almost like a chain reaction. In thinking about your own flywheel, it’s absolutely vital that it not be conceived as merely a list of static objectives that you’ve simply drawn as a circle. It must capture the sequence that ignites and accelerates momentum. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=79))

- the greatest danger in business and life lies not in outright failure but in achieving success without understanding why you were successful in the first place. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=85))

- One of the biggest, and most common, strategic mistakes lies in failing to aggressively and persistently make the most of victories. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=90))

- If Intel had tossed out its underlying flywheel architecture when it exited memories, it wouldn’t have become the dominant chip maker that powered the personal computer revolution. For a truly great company, the Big Thing is never any specific line of business or product or idea or invention. The Big Thing is your underlying flywheel architecture, properly conceived. If you get your flywheel right, it can guide and drive momentum (with renewal and extensions) for at least a decade, and likely much longer. Amazon, Vanguard, and Intel didn’t destroy their flywheels in response to a turbulent world; they disrupted the world around them by turning their flywheels.

- Create a list of significant replicable successes your enterprise has achieved. This should include new initiatives and offerings that have far exceeded expectations. Compile a list of failures and disappointments. This should include new initiatives and offerings by your enterprise that have failed outright or fell far below expectations. Compare the successes to the disappointments and ask, “What do these successes and disappointments tell us about the possible components of our flywheel?” Using the components you’ve identified (keeping it to four to six), sketch the flywheel. Where does the flywheel start—what’s the top of the loop? What follows next? And next after that? You should be able to explain why each component follows from the prior component. Outline the path back to the top of the loop. You should be able to explain how this loop cycles back upon itself to accelerate momentum.

- Test the flywheel against the three circles of your Hedgehog Concept. A Hedgehog Concept is a simple, crystalline concept that flows from deeply understanding the intersection of the following three circles: (1) what you’re deeply passionate about, (2) what you can be the best in the world at, and (3) what drives your economic or resource engine. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=151))

- And so, by adopting a key insight from Nike’s flywheel and blending it with his own passion for inventing great new products, Gentes created a flywheel that propelled Giro far beyond the garage: Invent great products; get elite athletes to use them; inspire Weekend Warriors to mimic their heroes; attract mainstream customers; and build brand power as more and more athletes use the products. But then, to maintain the “cool” factor, set high prices and channel profits back into creating the next generation of great products that elite athletes want to use.

- What matters most is how well you understand your flywheel and how well you execute on each component over a long series of iterations. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=178))

- To be clear, the big winners in corporate history consistently surpassed a threshold level of innovation required to compete in their industries. But what truly set the big winners apart was their ability to turn initial success into a sustained flywheel, even if they started out behind the pioneers.9 ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=186))

- The very nature of a flywheel—that it depends upon getting the sequence right and that every component depends on all the other components—means that you simply cannot falter on any primary component and sustain momentum. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=271))
1
- The flywheel, when properly conceived and executed, creates both continuity and change. On the one hand, you need to stay with a flywheel long enough to get its full compounding effect. On the other hand, to keep the flywheel spinning, you need to continually renew, and improve each and every component. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=277))
1
- There are two possible explanations for a stalled or stuck flywheel. Possible explanation #1: The underlying flywheel is just fine, but you’re failing to innovate and execute brilliantly on every single component; the flywheel needs to be reinvigorated. Possible explanation #2: The underlying flywheel no longer fits reality and must be changed in some significant way. It’s imperative that you make the right diagnosis.

- The big successes tended to make big bets after they’d empirically validated that the bet would pay off, whereas the less successful comparisons tended to make big bets before having empirical validation. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=328))

- In looking across the history of great companies in all our research studies, we find a frequent pattern. They usually begin life being successful in a specific business arena, making the most of their early big bets. But soon they make a conceptual shift from “running a business” to turning a flywheel. And over time, they extend that flywheel by firing bullets, then cannonballs. They crank the flywheel in their first arena of success, while simultaneously firing bullets to discover new things that might work, and as a hedge against uncertainty.

- In studying the horrifying fall of once-great companies, we see them abandoning the key principles that made them great in the first place. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=407))

- In our research for How the Mighty Fall, we found that the demise of once-great companies happens in five stages: (1) Hubris Born of Success, (2) Undisciplined Pursuit of More, (3) Denial of Risk and Peril, (4) Grasping for Salvation, and (5) Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death.

- The only legitimate form of discipline is self-discipline, having the inner will to do whatever it takes to create a great outcome, no matter how difficult. When you have disciplined people, you don’t need hierarchy. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFT5G7N&location=491))
1
- When you have disciplined thought, you don’t need bureaucracy. When you have disciplined action, you don’t need excessive controls. When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you create a powerful mixture that correlates with great performance.

- Those who lead organizations from good to great first get the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) and then figure out where to drive the bus.
