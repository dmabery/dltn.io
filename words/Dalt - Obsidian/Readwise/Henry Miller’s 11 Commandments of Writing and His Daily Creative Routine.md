- Under a part titled *Daily Program*, his routine also featured the following wonderful blueprint for productivity, inspiration, and mental health:
  > MORNINGS: 
  > If groggy, type notes and allocate, as stimulus.
  > 
  > If in fine fettle, write.
  > 
  > AFTERNOONS:
  > 
  > Work of section in hand, following plan of section scrupulously. No intrusions, no diversions. Write to finish one section at a time, for good and all.
  > 
  > EVENINGS:
  > 
  > See friends. Read in cafés.
  > 
  > Explore unfamiliar sections — on foot if wet, on bicycle if dry.
  > 
  > Write, if in mood, but only on Minor program.
  > 
  > Paint if empty or tired.
  > 
  > Make Notes. Make Charts, Plans. Make corrections of MS. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h49t6b1bh6mv5smb8j3defbg))
