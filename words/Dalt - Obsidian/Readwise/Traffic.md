B - Traffic

- Jonah leapt to take the bet, to show that he could re-create his success, systematize it, bottle it up. He knew where he needed to go to try his luck. Back in 2001, the young men at MIT knew that they needed to go not west, but south. The place to prove yourself in the nascent, experimental new media scene was downtown Manhattan.

- He saw a commercial future in news aggregation and distribution, and had written a memo for his bosses at the FT pushing for what was then a revolutionary tactic: linking to competing publications when their stories were better.

- So he moved back to San Francisco to work on what he saw as his real project, a website to change the way people consume news, called Moreover. He imagined consumers going to a single, centralized feed of news, rather than skipping from website to website—an early version of Google News—and worked on a technology called NewsBlogger that would allow readers to become writers, as the blogger Jason Kottke, a keen observer of the era, noted.

- He approached his board with an idea: they’d use their remaining cash to acquire the obscure publishing company Pyra, which had built a piece of software called Blogger. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=310))

- In 2003, an analytically minded DoubleClick salesman quit to found a company called Right Media, and started down the path to offering something different to advertisers: slots across many websites that would be able to target an individual consumer looking for fishing rods or cameras, regardless of where he or she was browsing.

- Kenny had read the book Duncan had just published, Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age. Duncan had reexamined the famous “small world” experiment from the 1960s, a landmark study in which strangers mailed letters to one another through friends of friends. Back then, the researchers concluded that Americans were on average separated from one another by six nodes. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=425))

- The National Rifle Association was fighting to end Bill Clinton’s ban on assault weapons. With Kenny’s money and Jonah’s brains, they’d find a way to stop this campaign. They decided to circulate a petition, but one infused with Jonah’s insights into what, in those days, he was calling “contagious media”—things like that Nike email that spread on their own, hand to hand and mouth to mouth, like a virus.

- Ana knew she wouldn’t be able to deliver, because she didn’t actually have any sources beyond her husband’s friends at The Washington Post (in, unhelpfully, the book section). So she found something else that would get traffic: an outrageous sense of humor. In her writing, she developed the persona of a “weird drunken housewife” ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=487))

- Advertisers were allergic to politics, it turned out—an old ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=513))

- Drudge made Monica Lewinsky’s name, and his own, famous with that story. He became the model of how traffic could mean money, power, and independence from any of the norms or controls that had traditionally come with a successful media venture. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=593))
1
- Clever reporters would email Drudge directly with their stories; cleverer ones would guess what Drudge might like, then write a story that fit his interests. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=597))

- Andrew described himself to Reason magazine as “Matt Drudge’s bitch.” ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=622))

- He didn’t have the attention span to build anything, Jonah concluded. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=633))
1
- So Jonah went searching for ideas. Among the people he looked to for inspiration was Nick Denton. Because while Jonah had spent his time thinking about how to make an idea spread, Nick and Drudge were the masters of something else: how to make a website “sticky.” They were masters of the refresh. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=702))

- Either way, you needed to tell someone about it, which is what made an idea “contagious.” ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=749))

    - Note: An idea is contagious when?
      You absolutely have to tell someone about it.

- The Showdown runner-up, Crying while Eating, had a different problem: people loved the site—and kept asking the creators how they planned to turn it into a business. “So what are your careers?” a puzzled Jay Leno asked them on The Tonight Show. (The stunt made it that big.) “Say you get a hundred million hits—you still don’t get any money?!” ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=782))

- There were, though, some false notes, suggestions Arianna didn’t quite speak the language of the world she was entering. In particular, the bloggers noted, she kept using the word “blog” to mean what they called “blog posts”; it was like calling a newspaper article a “newspaper.” ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=865))

- About six months in, Jonah decided they needed a website where they could show off their findings—a feed of all the buzz they were tracking, called BuzzFeed. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBKSJLN5&location=1104))

- In 2007, he began experimenting with something purer: a base salary, and bonuses based on page views. Traffic, after all, was basically money, denominated in CPMs. Why not measure labor in the same terms? This could get Nick around the tedious matters of office politics or editors’ tastes. Now, “a writer’s contributions can be measured,” he later wrote. He assigned each of his sites a page view rate, starting around $5. That meant that a writer making $2,000 a month would need to get more than four hundred thousand page views to start earning a bonus. A total of five hundred thousand views would get them a $500 bonus—but a huge hit could bring in thousands of extra dollars a month.
