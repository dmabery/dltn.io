A - Unsolicited Blogging Advice

1
- I have read way too many blogs, by developers, where they only talk about web development. Which is fine, I guess. But like in real life, if you only talk about the same thing over and over and over again, you'll end up alienating the people around you. So mix it up. Post a picture every now and then, talk about a book you read or a movie you watched or a place you visited. Talk about an interesting conversation. And don't be afraid to put things out there and to interact with other people. If you don't know where to start, hit me up via email and I'll be happy to help you out.
