    - Note: this is a great point...and a unique thing to see in today's world. any expert is trying to sell a course based on their knowledge.

- (From *Antifragile*: “Criticism, for a book, is a truthful, unfaked badge of attention, signaling that it is not boring; and boring is the only very bad thing for a book.”) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpwzvz860ywfsk6e52pj9kb))
