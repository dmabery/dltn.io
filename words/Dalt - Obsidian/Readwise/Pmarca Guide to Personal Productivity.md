A - Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity

- **Keep three and only three lists: a Todo List, a Watch List, and a Later List.**
  The more into lists you are, the more important this is.
  Into the Todo List goes all the stuff you “must” do—commitments, obligations, things that have to be done. A single list, possibly subcategorized by timeframe (today, this week, next week, next month).
  Into the Watch List goes all the stuff going on in your life that you have to follow up on, wait for someone else to get back to you on, remind yourself of in the future, or otherwise remember.
  Into the Later List goes everything else—everything you might want to do or will do when you have time or wish you could do.
  If it doesn’t go on one of those three lists, it goes away. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvkwwx9jpnjc4q3351wc7yb))

- I love this technique—being able to put more notches on my accomplishment belt, so to speak, by writing down things on my Anti-Todo list as I accomplish them throughout the day makes me feel marvelously productive and efficient. Far more so than if I just did those things and didn’t write them down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvky0hg4m37gjq3wse18mtp))

- The gist of Structured Procrastination is that you should never fight the tendency to procrastinate—instead, you should use it to your advantage in order to get other things done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvm1p7skvta36sqtpea4p8w))

- As John says, “The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered by importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvm2f5b97kmwskh4r406h9x))

- Third, **emails relating to topics that are current working projects or pressing issues go into temporary subfolders of a folder called Action**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvm5sker7jqbjse3c9nr4ca))

- Fourth, aside from those temporary Action subfolders, **only keep three standing email folders: Pending, Review, and Vault**.
  Emails that you know you’re going to have to deal with again—such as emails in which someone is committing something to you and you want to be reminded to follow up on it if the person doesn’t deliver—go in Pending.
  Emails with things you want to read in depth when you have more time, go into Review.
  Everything else goes into Vault.
  Every once in a while, sweep through your Action subfolders and dump any of them that you can into Vault. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvm6e3rsb55b69vh7ttyjfs))

- First, it fuels you up. Study after study have shown that breakfast is, yes, the most important meal of the day. It’s critical to properly fuel the body for the day’s activities and it’s also critical to staying lean or losing weight. (People who don’t have breakfast tend to eat more, and worse, at lunch.)

- As you’ve probably concluded by now, most of the tactics described in this post involve keeping oneself as free as possible to pursue one’s core interests, and dreams.
  If you’re not doing something you love with the majority of your time, and you have any personal freedom and flexibility whatsoever, it’s time for a change. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsvmak88atkp03w59dj8kdtx))

- I can tell you from personal experience that being stuck in a role where you have a lot of structure but feel like you never get anything done is *not* the optimal way to advance in one’s profession, or maximize one’s job satisfaction.

- For me, an organization system that requires significant time to deal with in and of itself is not optimal. Much better, for me at least, is to focus on stripping away nonessentials and freeing up as much time as possible to deal with whatever is most important.
