B - Outliers

1
- It’s not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn’t. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=202))
1
- like to call “accumulative advantage.” ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=327))
1
- Achievement is talent plus preparation. The problem with this view is that the closer psychologists look at the careers of the gifted, the smaller the role innate talent seems to play and the bigger the role preparation seems to play. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=413))
1
- Their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=432))
1
- Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes you good. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=459))
1
- Their success was not just of their own making. It was a product of the world in which they grew up. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=750))
1
- “that intellect and achievement are far from perfectly correlated.” ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=966))
1
- The particular skill that allows you to talk your way out of a murder rap, or convince your professor to move you from the morning to the afternoon section, is what the psychologist Robert Sternberg calls “practical intelligence.” ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=1090))
1
- practical intelligence includes things like “knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect.” ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=1091))
1
- But as is so often the case with outliers, buried in that setback was a golden opportunity. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=1353))
1
- Those three things—autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward—are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=1640))
1
- Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Once it does, it becomes the kind of thing that makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig. ([Location 1651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=1651))
1
- So far in Outliers we’ve seen that success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages: when and where you are born, what your parents did for a living, and what the circumstances of your upbringing were all make a significant difference in how well you do in the world. ([Location 1890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=1890))
1
- “mitigated speech,” which refers to any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said. ([Location 2085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2085))
1
- Our ability to succeed at what we do is powerfully bound up with where we’re from, and being a good pilot and coming from a high–power distance culture is a difficult mix. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2259))
1
- “No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.” ([Location 2594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2594))
1
- Virtually every success story we’ve seen in this book so far involves someone or some group working harder than their peers. ([Location 2599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2599))
1
- Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds. ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2670))
1
- “No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.”† ([Location 2697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2697))
1
- Virtually all of the advantage that wealthy students have over poor students is the result of differences in the way privileged kids learn while they are not in school. ([Location 2800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2800))
1
- Outliers are those who have been given opportunities—and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. ([Location 2910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2910))
1
- To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success—the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history—with a society that provides opportunities for all. ([Location 2919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=2919))
