A - Long Distance Thinking

- What is easy to explain is not necessarily what is best. What is easy to understand is not necessarily what is true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7ekqvr4mkrwvyyvyd9v0kd))

- Contemplation. We pass over this word too quickly to really consider what it means. It has fallen out of favor, outside of the occasional raiding of a thesaurus. I find it interesting that even the definition of *contemplate* has suffered from over-summarizing. The first dictionary definition, in today’s Merriam-Webster:
  > **To think deeply or carefully about (something)**
  > 
  > *I stopped to contemplate [=ponder] what might have happened. 
  > He contemplated the meaning of the poem for a long time. 
  > Life without them is too awful to contemplate. [=too awful to even think about]*
  Compare the brevity, and examples, to its first definition in Webster’s 1913 edition:
  > **To look at on all sides or in all its bearings; to view or consider with continued attention; to regard with deliberate care; to meditate on; to study.**
  > 
  > *To love, at least contemplate and admire, 
  > What I see excellent. 
  > —Milton*
  > 
  > *We thus dilate 
  > Our spirits to the size of that they contemplate. 
  > —Byron*
  And that same definition in Webster’s 1828 dictionary, his first edition:
  > **To view or consider with continued attention; to study; to meditate on. This word expresses the attention of the mind, but sometimes in connection with that of the eyes; as, to** ***contemplate*** **the heavens. More generally, the act of the mind only is intended; as, to** ***contemplate*** **the wonders of redemption; to** ***contemplate*** **the state of the nation and its future prospects.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7exn3ade20vpa4evw8ra2c))

- Language is a growing medium for thought, and here we witness something like soil compaction. Why? That nameless thread, it’s at work here, too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7etr0ey67mw37pgd8sz9cw))
