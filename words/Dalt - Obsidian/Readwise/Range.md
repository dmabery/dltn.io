B - Range

1
- “generation effect.” Struggling to generate an answer on your own, even a wrong one, enhances subsequent learning. ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1284))
1
- Tolerating big mistakes can create the best learning opportunities.* Kornell helped show ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1294))
1
- “training with hints did not produce any lasting learning.” ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1314))
1
- Struggling to retrieve information primes the brain for subsequent learning, even when the retrieval itself is unsuccessful. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1320))
1
- “spacing,” or distributed practice. It is what it sounds like—leaving time between practice sessions for the same material. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1327))
1
- For a given amount of material, learning is most efficient in the long run when it is really inefficient in the short run. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1345))
1
- Psychologist Robert Bjork first used the phrase “desirable difficulties” in 1994. Twenty years later, he ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1388))
1
- “Above all, the most basic message is that teachers and students must avoid interpreting current performance as learning. Good performance on a test during the learning process can indicate mastery, but learners and teachers need to be aware that such performance will often index, instead, fast but fleeting progress.” ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1389))
1
- Interleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1423))
1
- The feeling of learning, it turns out, is based on before-your-eyes progress, while deep learning is not. “When your intuition says block,” Kornell told me, “you should probably interleave.” ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1438))
1
- Whether chemists, physicists, or political scientists, the most successful problem solvers spend mental energy figuring out what type of problem they are facing before matching a strategy to it, rather than jumping in with memorized procedures. ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1448))
1
- Teaching kids to read a little early is not a lasting advantage. Teaching them how to hunt for and connect contextual clues to understand what they read can ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1466))
1
- Learning deeply means learning slowly. ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1473))
1
- The cult of the head start fails the learners it seeks to serve. ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1473))
1
- When a knowledge structure is so flexible that it can be applied effectively even in new domains or extremely novel situations, it is called “far transfer.” ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1478))
1
- But what he really did, whenever he was stuck, was to think entirely outside the domain. He left a brightly lit trail of his favorite ([Location 1534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1534))
1
- Deep analogical thinking is the practice of recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains or scenarios that may seem to have little in common on the surface. ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1540))
1
- Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1546))
1
- the course of studying problem solving in the 1930s, Karl Duncker posed one of the most famous hypothetical problems in all of cognitive psychology. It goes like this: ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1567))
1
- The answer is that you (the doctor) could direct multiple low-intensity rays at the tumor from different directions, leaving healthy tissue intact, but converging at the tumor site with enough collective intensity to destroy it. ([Location 1591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1591))
1
- “If you need a large force to accomplish some purpose, but are prevented from applying such a force directly, many smaller forces applied simultaneously from different directions may work just as well.” ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1599))
1
- They will stay inside of the problem at hand, focused on the internal details, and perhaps summon other medical knowledge, since it is on the surface a medical problem. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1616))
1
- We take the inside view when we make judgments based narrowly on the details of a particular project that are right in front of us. ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1623))
1
- Our natural inclination to take the inside view can be defeated by following analogies to the “outside view.” ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1633))
1
- Evaluating an array of options before letting intuition reign is a trick for the wicked world. ([Location 1689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1689))
1
- “variety of base domains,” which foster analogical thinking and conceptual connections that can help students categorize the type of problem they are facing. ([Location 1735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1735))
1
- successful problem solvers are more able to determine the deep structure of a problem before they proceed to match a strategy to it. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1738))
1
- Mars appears to reverse course in the sky, do a little loop, and then carry on in the original direction, a feat known as retrograde motion. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1750))
1
- Dunbar witnessed important breakthroughs live, and saw that the labs most likely to turn unexpected findings into new knowledge for humanity made a lot of analogies, and made them from a variety of base domains. ([Location 1780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1780))

- anonymity. An ecstatic review cast him as a revolutionary ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1908))
1
- “Match quality” is a term economists use to describe the degree of fit between the work someone does and who they are—their abilities and proclivities. ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1930))
1
- Malamud’s conclusion: “The benefits to increased match quality . . . outweigh the greater loss in skills.” ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1958))
1
- Learning stuff was less important than learning about oneself. Exploration is not just a whimsical luxury of education; it is a central benefit. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1959))
1
- In England and Wales, adults were more likely to get divorced from the careers they had invested in because they settled down too early. If we treated careers more like dating, nobody would settle down so quickly. ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1964))
1
- Switchers are winners. It seems to fly in the face of hoary adages about quitting, and of far newer concepts in modern psychology. ([Location 1984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1984))
1
- In the mess hall for breakfast, new cadets, or “plebes,” must sit straight in their chairs and bring food to their mouths, not their faces toward their plates. ([Location 1990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=1990))
1
- She had been talking to high performers across domains, and decided to study passion and perseverance, a combination she cleverly formulated as “grit.” She designed a self-assessment that captured the two components of grit. One is essentially work ethic and resilience, and the other is “consistency of interests”—direction, knowing exactly what one wants. ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2001))
1
- “winners”—he generally meant individuals who reach the apex of their domain—quit fast and often when they detect that a plan is not the best fit, and do not feel bad about it. ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2052))
1
- every single person, before undertaking an endeavor, should enumerate conditions under which they should quit. ([Location 2055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2055))
1
- Should those few who left have finished instead? Perhaps, if they quit in a moment of simple panic, rather than as a reassessment of the future they wanted in light of this new information about military life. ([Location 2061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2061))

- Where dangling money for junior officers failed miserably, facilitating match quality succeeded. ([Location 2108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2108))
1
- A few years later, with more knowledge of their skills and preferences, choosing to pursue a different goal was no longer the gritless route; it was the smart one. ([Location 2116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2116))
1
- Sasha Cohen, a 2006 silver medalist figure skater, wrote an advice column to retiring athletes. “Olympic athletes need to understand that the rules for life are different from the rules for sports,” she wrote. “Yes, striving to accomplish a single overarching goal every day means you have grit, determination and resilience. But the ability to pull yourself together mentally and physically in competition is different from the new challenges that await you. So after you retire, travel, write a poem, try to start your own business, stay out a little too late, devote time to something that doesn’t have a clear end goal.” ([Location 2152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2152))

- “The more we have invested and even lost,” Konnikova wrote, “the longer we will persist in insisting it will all work out.” ([Location 2165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2165))

1
- right away asked what training had prepared her for leadership. Wrong question. “Oh, don’t ask me what my training was,” she replied with a dismissing hand wave. She explained that she just did whatever seemed like it would teach her something and allow her to be of service at each moment, and somehow that added up to training. ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2280))
1
- “I did not intend to become a leader, I just learned by doing what was needed at the time.” ([Location 2283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2283))
1
- “You have to carry a big basket to bring something home.” She repeats that phrase today, to mean that a mind kept wide open will take something from every new experience. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2290))
1
- Dark horses were on the hunt for match quality. “They never look around and say, ‘Oh, I’m going to fall behind, these people started earlier and have more than me at a younger age,’” Ogas told me. “They focused on, ‘Here’s who I am at the moment, here are my motivations, here’s what I’ve found I like to do, here’s what I’d like to learn, and here are the opportunities. Which of these is the best match right now? And maybe a year from now I’ll switch because I’ll find something better.’” ([Location 2307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2307))
1
- Each dark horse had a novel journey, but a common strategy. “Short-term planning,” ([Location 2311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2311))
1
- “wasn’t much for setting goals,” and that his main goal for his nascent shoe company was to fail fast enough that he could apply what he was learning to his next venture. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2317))
1
- Our work preferences and our life preferences do not stay the same, because we do not stay the same. ([Location 2338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2338))
1
- The only certainty is change, both on average as a generation ages, and within each individual. ([Location 2351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2351))
1
- Instead of asking whether someone is gritty, we should ask when they are. ([Location 2395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2395))
1
- we learn who we are only by living, and not before. ([Location 2411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2411))

- Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. ([Location 2454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2454))
1
- I propose instead that you don’t commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward. ([Location 2457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2457))
1
- Michelangelo learned who he was—and whom he was carving—in practice, not in theory. He started with an idea, tested it, changed it, and readily abandoned it for a better project fit. Michelangelo might have fit well in Silicon Valley; he was a relentless iterator. He worked according to Ibarra’s new aphorism: “I know who I am when I see what I do.” ([Location 2467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2467))
1
- Virtually every good thing in my life I can trace back to a misfortune, so my feeling is you don’t know what’s good and what’s bad when things happen. You do not know. You have to wait to find out.” ([Location 2478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2478))
1
- “I began painting pictures in Jan-1976—without any training. This is my painting. A person don’t know what he can do unless he tryes. Trying things is the answer to find your talent.” ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2543))
1
- Bingham calls it “outside-in” thinking: finding solutions in experiences far outside of focused training for the problem itself. ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2582))
1
- “I think it happens more often than we’d love to admit, because we tend to view things with all the information we’ve gathered in our industry, and sometimes that puts us down a path that goes into a wall. ([Location 2640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2640))
1
- Einstellung effect, a psychology term for the tendency of problem solvers to employ only familiar methods even if better ones are available. ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2642))
1
- an outsider who may be far away from the surface of the problem reframes the problem in a way that unlocks the solution.” ([Location 2664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2664))

1
- Lateral thinking is a term coined in the 1960s for the reimagining of information in new contexts, including the drawing together of seemingly disparate concepts or domains that can give old ideas new uses. ([Location 2887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2887))
1
- But there is a well-documented tendency people have to consider only familiar uses for objects, an instinct known as functional fixedness. ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=2959))
1
- “If you’re working on well-defined and well-understood problems, specialists work very, very well,” he told me. “As ambiguity and uncertainty increases, which is the norm with systems problems, breadth becomes increasingly important.” ([Location 3110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3110))
1
- The higher the domain uncertainty, the more important it was to have a high-breadth team member. ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3119))
1
- If not experience, repetition, or resources, what helped creators make better comics on average and innovate? The answer (in addition to not being overworked) was how many of twenty-two different genres a creator had worked in, from comedy and crime, to fantasy, adult, nonfiction, and sci-fi. ([Location 3141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3141))
1
- an individual creator who had worked in four or more genres was more innovative than a team whose members had collective experience across the same number of genres. Taylor and Greve suggested that “individuals are capable of more creative integration of diverse experiences than teams are.” ([Location 3146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3146))
1
- “high tolerance for ambiguity”; “systems thinkers”; “additional technical knowledge from peripheral domains”; “repurposing what is already available”; “adept at using analogous domains for finding inputs to the invention process”; “ability to connect disparate pieces of information in new ways”; “synthesizing information from many different sources”; “they appear to flit among ideas”; ([Location 3174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3174))
1
- Serial Innovators, ([Location 3195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3195))
1
- The problem is that we often expect the hyperspecialist, because of their expertise in a narrow area, to magically be able to extend their skill to wicked problems. The results can be disastrous. ([Location 3208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3208))

- Foxes see complexity in what others mistake for simple cause and effect. ([Location 3443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3443))
1
- They understand that most cause-and-effect relationships are probabilistic, not deterministic. There are unknowns, and luck, and even when history apparently repeats, it does not do so precisely. They recognize that they are operating in the very definition of a wicked learning environment, where it can be very hard to learn, from either wins or losses.

- They needed to improvise rather than throw out information that did not fit the established rubric. ([Location 3687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3687))
1
- Weick called overlearned behavior. That is, they have done the same thing in response to the same challenges over and over until the behavior has become so automatic that they no longer even recognize it as a situation-specific tool. ([Location 3694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3694))
1
- The researcher who led that work went on to study thousands of businesses. She found that the most effective leaders and organizations had range; they were, in effect, paradoxical. They could be demanding and nurturing, orderly and entrepreneurial, even hierarchical and individualistic all at once. A level of ambiguity, it seemed, was not harmful. In decision making, it can broaden an organization’s toolbox in a way that is uniquely valuable. ([Location 3809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=3809))
