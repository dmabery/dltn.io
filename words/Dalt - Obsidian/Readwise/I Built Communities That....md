T - I Built Communities That...

1
- I built communities that created 83m new customers in 2020 with this marketing framework
  I'm curious your thoughts
  A startup marketing manifesto: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174620912885761))
1
- Connect the disconnected
  1. Find people who want to pursue a goal (ex: new immigrants in the US, learn tennis etc)
  2. Accelerate them
  This will do more for your business than you can imagine ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174621680459777))
1
- Customers need to feel lucky. Like the chosen ones
  Lucky to be a part of the community. Lucky to buy the product. Lucky to be a part of your story
  If you nail the “luckiness” feeling, you can drive your marketing costs to zero ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174622481551360))
1
- How to jumpstart & structure community:
  - Masterclass for X
  - Clubhouse for X
  - Q&A platforms 
  - Small virtual events
  - Gaming events 
  - Text your community’s leader 
  - etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174623316226052))
1
- Have a design aesthetic. Own it
  Make sure your niche is in love with it
  Daring design aesthetics pay dividends ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174624142491651))
1
- Amplify social proof
  Social proof probably drives 80% of our economy
  Are you amplifying enough? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174624859668481))
1
- The missing tab on 99% of websites: What we stand for
  Stand for something
  "What we stand for" matters more now than ever ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174625585332233))
1
- Community is a retention machine. It drives human connection
  And connection keeps customers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174626319360004))
1
- Don't spend your budget on large influencers. Partner with microinfluencers
  Best bang for the buck
  Start small to go big ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174627086893060))
1
- Build a double-sided referral program
  1. Reward current customers ($10 off your next purchase)
  2. Reward prospects ($10 when you sign up)
  Everybody wins ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174627820908548))
1
- Tell a great story. Almost every product sold comes with a story
  Easier said than done. DM and try to answer as many questions on storytelling as humanly possible
  Great stories aren't told to everyone. They are told to niches. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174628630396929))
1
- Be emotional
  Companies that wear their hearts on their sleeves feel authentic. It cuts the noise
  Emotional connection sells more than product features ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174629481807882))
1
- Be different
  "If you want to stand for something. You can’t stand for everything."
  Say no to being the same. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174630299697154))
1
- Internet marketing stunts works. It will be your "big break"
  What's something that your audience will eat up?
  Think big. Then think bigger. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174631000207360))
1
- Not investing in community is an expensive habit
  The tiny cost of building a community is dwarfed by the huge cost of not trying
  Start today ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174631784517633))
1
- Build an email list as early as you possibly can
  Relying on Facebook etc is risky business ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174632547880967))
1
- "100 true fans" is the new "1000 true fans"
  You don't need customers. You need hardcore customers
  Find them first, and then you'll find your customers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1363174633344794626))
