A - The Other Half of "Artists Ship"

1
- One of the differences between big companies and startups is that big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves against mistakes. A startup walks like a toddler, bashing into things and falling over all the time. A big company is more deliberate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0c7rdd0g52w6v4j6n4c9na))

- The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all suppliers to prove they're solvent before submitting bids.

- or (probably more often) by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs for protecting against new types of disasters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0c8v5h459b2pf8t1fq9kcy))

    - Note: didn't think about processes this way

- *Every check has a cost.* For example, consider the case of making suppliers verify their solvency. Surely that's mere prudence? But in fact it could have substantial costs. There's obviously the direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check proofs of the supplier's solvency. But the real costs are the ones you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier, but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified. Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short of the threshold for solvencyâ€”which will of course have been set on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.

- Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing? Is it higher in some areas than others? Where does it increase discontinuously? If large organizations started to ask questions like that, they'd learn some frightening things.

- Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code. Or more precisely, when they release more code. Programmers like to make a difference. Good ones, anyway.
  For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a startup is that there are few checks on releases. In true startups, there are no external checks at all. If you have an idea for a new feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production servers before lunch. And when you can do that, you have more ideas.

    - Note: ideas are a function of work. this is another reason why you don't see big companies innovating, b/c too many people are writing reports and not doing work

- I was talking recently to a group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few years before by a big company. When they'd been independent, they could release changes instantly. Now, they said, the absolute fastest they could get code released on the production servers was two weeks.
  This didn't merely make them less productive. It made them hate working for the acquirer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0cfxm0p04prxb29d9q4kg9))
1
- And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not that you overpay but that the best suppliers won't even sell to you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your programmers is not that you'll make them unproductive, but that good programmers won't even want to work for you.

- Steve Jobs's famous maxim "artists ship" works both ways. Artists aren't merely capable of shipping. They insist on it. So if you don't let people ship, you won't have any artists. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0chbksnwdc9cy19qym7kd1))
