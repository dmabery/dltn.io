A - C.S. Lewis on Chronological Snobbery

1
- Lewis defines this chronological snobbery as “the uncritical acceptance of the intellectual climate of our own age and the assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that count discredited.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0fc5zx916m1e6mt29zhxj))

- In other words, you need to determine if an old idea is false before you reject it; we would not want to say that everything believed in an ancient culture was false. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0g2xyv89sxvkhsegnchdj))

- In Colossians 2:8 we are warned to “Beware of philosophy .…” Some believers have used this as a pretext for avoiding the subject altogether, but the only way to beware of philosophy is to be aware of it. Otherwise, you might fall captive to an alien philosophy and not know it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0h4jehwy00235cwqz3a3b))

- Lewis advocated letting the “breezes of the centuries” blow through our minds. We can do this by reading old books. In fact, Lewis made it a rule of thumb that one should read at least as many old books as new ones ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0j0ych5fn2005qh7pz126))

- Lewis wrote:
  *It’s a good rule after reading a new book never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an* 
  *old one in between. If that is too much for you, you should at least read one old one to three new ones....* 
  *Every age has its own outlook. It is especially good at seeing certain truths and especially liable to make* 
  *certain mistakes. We all therefore need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own* 
  *period.... None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it, and weaken our* 
  *guard against it, if we read only modern books....The only palliative is to keep the clean sea breeze of the* 
  *centuries blowing through our minds and this can only be done by reading old books.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0k2kf07f3e3bfvn6a9sg4))

- *But progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be and if you* 
  *have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road,* 
  *progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case, the man who* 
  *turns back soonest is the most progressive man.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0n5nt17yecyzerdeng7z6))

- There is nothing progressive about being pigheaded and refusing to admit a mistake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0nfd6sytm05cdhk4vgbqg))

- Lewis says:
  *This very obvious fact—that each generation is taught by an earlier generation—must be kept firmly* 
  *in mind. The beliefs which boys fresh from school now hold are the beliefs of the Twenties. The beliefs* 
  *which boys from school will hold in the Sixties will be largely those of the undergraduates today. The* 
  *moment we forget this we begin to talk nonsense about education.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0s9gwaskmpr15xqnk10q3))

- *No generation can bequeath to its successor* 
  *what it has not got. … if we are skeptical we shall teach only skepticism to our pupils, if fools only folly,* 
  *if vulgar only vulgarity, if saints sanctity, if heroes heroism.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0swnmk13hm26prr7ygyjm))

- If we really want to be skeptical about the past, be skeptical about the present. “Chronological snobbery” thoroughly applied would lead to questioning all of our present fashions. Those who neglect past history tend to be enslaved to the recent past. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0g0tr22teahspgppcjvzgej))
