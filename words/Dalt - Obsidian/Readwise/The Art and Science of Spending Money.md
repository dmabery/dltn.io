A - The Art and Science of Spending Money

1
- How you spend money can reveal an existential struggle of what you find valuable in life, who you want to spend time with, why you chose your career, and the kind of attention you want from other people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv8ynjm2ay5d5kzsmcrxcra))

- Even when “wound” is the wrong word, the desire to show the world that you’ve made it increases if you grew up snubbed out of what you wanted. To someone who grew up in an old-money affluent family, a Lamborghini might be a symbol of gaudy egotism; to those who grew up with nothing, the car might serve as the ultimate symbol that you’ve made it.

- In 1875 an op-ed said socialites “devote themselves to pleasure regardless of expense.” A Vanderbilt heir responded that actually they “devote themselves to expense regardless of pleasure.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv92740vmth0jr1nzsn7wxr))

- I’ve often wondered how many personal bankruptcies and financial troubles were caused by spending that brought no joy to begin with. It must be enormous. And it’s a double loss: not only are you in trouble, but you didn’t even have fun getting there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv92ym7smkxrtxb9d05pmr2))

- But what about those whose spending is driven by the belief that money is to be spent, regardless of what pleasure it brings? Money has them by the neck; they are held in captivity by its influence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv93gngyc6mnnypwefvw7c6))

- We have zero regrets – the house really was great. But no one should pretend that you can make life-changing decisions that will massively impact you and your family and treat it like a math problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv95qx9kr5j55vqtevwb9ad))

- **The joy of spending can diminish as income rises because there’s less struggle, sacrifice, and sweat represented in purchases.**
  In his 1903 book *The Quest for the Simple Life*, William Dawson writes:
  > The thing that is least perceived about wealth is that all pleasure in money ends at the point where economy becomes unnecessary. The man who can buy anything he covets, without any consultation with his banker, values nothing that he buys. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv96yewx0a1xwh01j8ev54f))

- There’s a saying that the best meal you’ll ever taste is a glass of water when you’re thirsty. All forms of spending have that equivalent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv984ktp48d3945aqyxf483))

- So while there are those that would disagree with this and say “Gee, if I could just be a millionaire! That would be the most wonderful thing.” If I could just not have to work every day, if I could just be out fishing or hunting or playing golf or traveling, that would be the most wonderful life in the world – they don’t know life. Because what makes life mean something is purpose. A goal. The battle. the struggle – even if you don’t win it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv995gsf54q5cf25qdbf8mh))

- There’s a saying: Save a little bit of money each month, and at the end of the year you’ll be surprised at how little you still have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv99f78rz28rsjxy82b1qtb))

- Historian Cyril Parkinson coined a thing called Parkinson’s Law of Triviality. It states: “The amount of attention a problem gets is the inverse of its importance.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv9a1r2jce9k7yvtw5qvg3g))

- Parkinson described a fictional finance committee with three tasks: approval of a $10 million nuclear reactor, $400 for an employee bike shed, and $20 for employee refreshments in the break room.
  The committee approves the $10 million nuclear reactor immediately, because the number is too big to contextualize, alternatives are too daunting to consider, and no one on the committee is an expert in nuclear power.
  The bike shed gets considerably more debate. Committee members argue whether a bike rack would suffice and whether a shed should be wood or aluminum, because they have some experience working with those materials at home.
  Employee refreshments take up two-thirds of the debate, because everyone has a strong opinion on what’s the best coffee, the best cookies, the best chips, etc.

- Price is easy to calculate. It’s just whatever you paid initially and sold for eventually.
  Cost is harder to figure out. They tend to be a slow drip over time, which are easy to ignore but add up quickly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxxwr8xy6nkmx3rxt5p3hnx))

    - Note: Things cost way more than their initial price. A new set of golf clubs doesn’t just cost $1,000 or whatever you pay for the set. No, it also costs all of the bucket of balls you buy at the driving range to work on your swing. It also costs the new shoes and polos you buy to show others you’re not a newb. It also costs the rounds of golf + food + beer you now play every other week. It also costs $50 for each box of ProV1s you buy to, once again, sho others you aren’t a newb.
      Every purchase has this. The previous example is what’s been called the “Diderot Effect.”

- Same for cars, boats, and hobbies. You can even say the cost of smoking cigarettes is the price of a pack plus the long-term cost of medical care associated with the habit. One is easy to calculate, the other is very difficult. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxxx1j345tff79a0zb8w9mz))

- There is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.

- I wrote a letter to my son the day he was born. It says, in part:
  > You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration from other people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does – especially from the people you want to respect and admire you.

- 10. Not knowing what kind of spending will make you happy because you haven’t tried enough new and strange forms of spending. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxy5rgb91r17grjy3ewesa6))

    - Note: If you’re not sure what to do or what to pursue, it’s often not because you’re lost or are having a mid-life crisis. Instead, it’s probably because you just haven’t tried enough things to find the one that makes you go, “Oh yeah. This is what I love.”

- Evolution is the most powerful force in the world, capable of transforming single-cell organisms into modern humans.
  But evolution has no idea what it’s doing. There’s no guide, no manual, no rulebook. It’s not even necessarily good at selecting traits that work.
  Its power is that it “tries” trillions upon trillions of different mutations and is ruthless about killing off the ones that don’t work. What’s left – the winners – stick around. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxy7qka9nqx1t6nvey05ek4))

- There’s a theory in evolutionary biology called Fisher’s Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. It’s the idea that variance equals strength, because the more diverse a population is the more chances it has to come up with new traits that can be selected for. No one can know what traits will be useful; that’s not how evolution works. But if you create a lot of traits, the useful one – whatever it is – will be in there somewhere.

- Here’s Ramit Sethi again: “Frugality, quite simply, is about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on—and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxy9fwz1mat5kntq5c7kra6))

    - Note: Coffee and books for me. Food and travel are things I don’t like very much.

- That should spark three questions: Who are you trying to influence, why, and are those people even paying attention? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxychnb39d6yfhqxdtdqfjr))

- An old joke is about two hikers who come across a grizzly bear in the woods. One starts to run, and the other yells, “Are you crazy, you can’t outrun a bear!” The runner replies: “I don’t have to be faster than the bear. I only have to be faster than you.”
  All success is simply relative to someone else – usually those around you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxycz0yvt4pb20z5vay4wyx))

- Montesquieu wrote 275 years ago, “If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxye9h74n88fyfma0npn4fj))
