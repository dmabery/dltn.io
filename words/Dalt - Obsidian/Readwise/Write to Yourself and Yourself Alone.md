A - Write to Yourself and Yourself Alone

- I've heard this idea before, but I did not learn until recently just *how many* great writers operated on this philosophy—across time and place.
  Seneca:
  > "Scorn the pleasure which comes from the applause of the majority. Many men praise you; but have you any reason for being pleased with yourself, if you are a person whom the many can understand? Your good qualities should face inwards."
  Seneca cites Democritus:
  > "One man means as much to me as a multitude, and a multitude only as much as one man."
  He also cites Epicurus:
  > "I write this not for the many, but for you; each of us is enough of an audience for the other." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1znjhtnve5qsw4kf6kzrnxx))

- In the *[Essays](https://amzn.to/3LSSgyj?ref=otherlife.co)*, Montaigne says:
  > "And if no one reads me, have I wasted my time, entertaining myself for so many idle hours with such useful and agreeable thoughts?" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1znknk50ydzmft1z0k09dzm))

- Virginia Woolf in *[A Room of One's Own:](https://amzn.to/3Kd6vNa?ref=otherlife.co)*
  > “So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say. But to sacrifice a hair of the head of your vision, a shade of its colour, in deference to some Headmaster with a silver pot in his hand or to some professor with a measuring-rod up his sleeve, is the most abject treachery, and the sacrifice of wealth and chastity which used to be said to be the greatest of human disasters, a mere flea-bite in comparison.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1znn3wde2hyx6wmhpm29kc4))

- Cyril Connolly said in *The New Statesman* (1933):
  > “Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no self." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1znnbns5bn630vktt78fwcd))

- In a letter to Auden from 1955, Tolkien says:
  > "I wrote the Trilogy as a personal satisfaction, driven to it by the scarcity of literature of the sort that I wanted to read... I was not thinking much of the profit or delight of others." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1znnnzcqzbxfgfxryz7rnr6))

- Harper Lee in a 1964 interview:
  > "People who write for reward by way of recognition or monetary gain don't know what they're doing. They're in the category of those who write; they are not writers. Writing is simply something you must do. It's rather like virtue in that it is its own reward. Writing is selfish and contradictory in its terms. First of all, you're writing for an audience of one, you must please the one person you're writing for. Yourself." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1znpaxef9becj6fraw5swc8))
