A - A Storyteller's Shoptalk

1
- Ambition and a little luck are good things for a writer to have going for him. Too much ambition and bad luck, or no luck at all, can be killing. There has to be talent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgks7dypt8z2df27dhpz93k))

- It's akin to style, what I'm talking about, but it isn't style alone. It is the writer's particular and unmistakable signature on everything he writes. It is his world and no other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgm4e7hc5v9p815yrdh2sxh))

- But a writer who has some special way of looking at things and who gives artistic expression to that way of looking: that writer may be around for a time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgm4vyqm5ewjkjz0yzec617))

- Isak Dinesen said that she wrote a little every day, without hope and without despair. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgm54jp9zwa8k5yy2ahsnns))

- Writers don't need tricks or gimmicks or even necessarily need to be the smartest fellows on the block. At the risk of appearing foolish, a writer sometimes needs to be able to just stand and gape at this or that thing - a sunset or an old shoe - in absolute and simple amazement.

- In Isaac Babel's wonderful short story, ''Guy de Maupassant,'' the narrator has this to say about the writing of fiction: ''No iron can pierce the heart with such force as a period put just at the right place.'' This too ought to go on a three-by-five. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgmamzwbbw08mqght0b5fvs))

- Evan Connell said once that he knew he was finished with a short story when he found himself going through it and taking out commas and then going through the story again and putting commas back in the same places. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgmazmsvamhctbkd50ebt0s))

- ''It would have been better if I'd taken the time.'' I was dumbfounded when I heard a novelist friend say this. I still am, if I think about it, which I don't. It's none of my business. But if the writing can't be made as good as it is within us to make it, then why do it? In the end it's all we have, the only thing we can take into the grave. I wanted to say to my friend, for heaven's sake go do something else. There have to be easier and maybe more honest ways to try and earn a living. Or else just do it to the best of your abilities, your talents, and then don't justify or make excuses. Don't complain, don't explain.

- In an essay called, simply enough, ''Writing Short Stories,'' Flannery O'Connor ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwgmpt30y4rzasm0d4e0w3ey))

- O'Connor says she most often did not know where she was going when she sat down to work on a short story. She says she doubts that many writers know where they are going when they begin something. She uses ''Good Country People'' as an example of how she put together a short story whose ending she could not even guess at until she was nearly there:
  ''When I started writing that story, I didn't know there was going to be a Ph.D. with a wooden leg in it. I merely found myself one morning writing a description of two women I knew something about, and before I realized it, I had equipped one of them with a daughter with a wooden leg. I brought in the Bible salesman, but I had no idea what I was going to do with him. I didn't know he was going to steal that wooden leg until ten or twelve lines before he did it, but when I found out that this was what was going to happen, I realized it was inevitable.''

- What creates tension in a piece of fiction is partly the way the concrete words are linked together to make up the visible action of the story. But it's also the things that are left out, that are implied, the landscape just under the smooth (but sometimes broken and unsettled) surface of things.

- V.S. Pritchett's definition of a short story is ''something glimpsed from the corner of the eye, in passing.'' ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwjgd9kt24g6teq011vpmd58))
