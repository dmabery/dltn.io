A - Matt Mullenweg on simple productivity and the future of blogging.

1
- 5 – Ask “what’s the most minimal thing I need to be productive?”
  Let’s get one thing straight…
  YOU DON’T NEED a perfect productive setting to be productive.
  When I want peak productivity, here’s my ideal setting:
  1. no kids
  2. at a coffee shop–with fiber internet
  3. with mug of black coffee
  4. with my headphones on
  5. wearing comfy sweats
  6. and comfy socks
  7. having already stretched my legs and back for 10 minutes
  The total number of hours a week I can manage all 7 of those?
  Maybe 2 hours.

  So what’s the minimum I need to be productive?
  My laptop, a place to sit or stand and type, and an internet connection.
  **Theoretically, I can be equally productive with just those two things.**
  Waiting for the ideal setting to sit down and attempt work is just *resistance* at work (Stephen Pressfield reference from my fave book). This is the real “secret” to getting more done, in my opinion. Don’t wait for “prime productive conditions.”
  Train yourself to sit and work whenever the opportunity presents itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7vw0je9vskcc1szr13ppyf))
