A - 20 Dialog Mistakes, and What to Do Instead

1
- Dialog that conforms to the rules of formal grammar feels *wrong* to the reader, because we don’t hear people talk that way. It ruins verisimilitude and gets in the way of reader immersion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vd1tqza9m2z3b9xvq9kem))
1
- every line a reader goes through that doesn’t move the story forward risks losing their attention. If you lose their attention, it can be very hard to get it back. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vejxsnkjwzx415ywzvy29))

- Make sure all of your dialog serves not just one purpose, but two. It must move the story forward in some way, and ideally reveal something else about a character, the world, or the conflict of the story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vezawbv5frbgw1992b23w))

- *I dropped my toothpaste,” Tom said, crestfallen.*
  *“I lost my hat!” Tom said, off the top of his head.*
  Tom Swifties are a joke or party game where you make a pun by adding a dialog tag to a quote, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vgssq947qzd3avqn06q16))

- Always remember: asking a reader to do extra work to enjoy your story results in a lost reader more often than it gives a reader a better experience. Reading the sentence above made you think and hesitate, to slow down. Most readers don’t want that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vhypxy94yfqfef7t9davv))

- 8. Dialog That Repeats Exposition
  *John’s hat fell off his head. “Darnit, I dropped my hat!” he said.* 
  It’s usually a mistake to say anything twice in a book, lest you lose reader interest by being boring and repetitive. Many authors make this mistake by having a character repeat in dialog what recently happened on the page. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vjg7944ct84ahqvgdh945))

- 9. Dialog Without Differentiation
  *“I ate the pie. I loved it,” said Mary.* 
  *“I loved eating that pie,” said John.*
  No two people you know in real life talk the same way. No two people in your book should, either. If everybody’s dialog feels the same, the characters will also feel very similar. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vk00jyhcwp6m5z6kz29r3))

- 12. Dialog With Small Talk
  *“So, how are the kids?”*
  *“They’re great! John’s in grad school, and Mary just got out of the Army with a job in the private sector. Anyway, about that murder…”*
  Small talk is such a part of normal conversation that interactions feel abrupt and rude without a little of it, but it has very little place on the written page. Remember what we said earlier about dialog without a purpose? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vmq853hasxz1jtvxx20ar))

- 15. Dialog Where Characters Say What They Mean
  *“Mary, I’m really angry with you for eating my cat,” John said.* 
  *“I understand that, but I wouldn’t have done it if you hadn’t gone on that date with Sharon.”*
  *“Oh, I didn’t realize that hurt your feelings. I’m so sorry.”*
  This is the emotional version of the first mistake in that it’s not natural to the way people communicate. People very rarely say exactly what they mean in conversation. Instead, we tend to hide our motivations, fears, and desires beneath multiple layers of words. We’re so used to this, as humans, that we automatically cut through most of them when we talk with people, and overly open communication tends to weird us out.

- 17. Dialog in a Vacuum
  Reread the examples in this article. Most of them exist in a vacuum, with no information given except for who’s speaking and what they have to say. That works in this case because the dialog is the entire point of the examples. Giving the conversations context distracts the reader from the main point.
  In your book, this will almost never be appropriate. Nobody just stands in a dark or featureless room and talks. Conversations happen in situations, and the speakers move around each other and the other things in the room. Describing what happens around dialog creates pacing, and makes the scene fully realized on the page. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h81vr0hmxk6zsy3sxf0hqvyh))

- 19. Dialog Where Action Belongs
  *“OW! Stop hitting me!” John yelled.*
  Remember earlier where we said you shouldn’t write dialog where exposition does the job better? The same is true for action. Action scenes need to be tight, spare, written in as few words as you can. Dialog can’t do that job, so write the action out normally.
