- “With mental models, you learn to walk by falling down,” he told me. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311978))
1
- The way to get rid of the bullshit and the LARPing is to honestly attempt to connect the mental model in your head to the results in the world—if you do this enough, real understanding will start to click into place. In short, just having experiences and using fancy words doesn’t actually teach you anything. You have to reflect on your experiences to generate actual understanding ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311979))
1
- This is a process he calls the Learning Loop: having experiences, reflecting on those experiences, and using them to refine your model of the world so that you can do better next time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311981))
1
- We tend to think that we learn through having an experience but that’s not how we learn at all. We learn by reflecting on an experience. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311982))
1
- It works in a cycle that I call the ‘learning loop’. Think about a clock: at twelve o’clock on the dial, you have an experience. At three o’clock, you reflect upon that experience. At six, that reflection creates an abstraction—a mental model—and at nine, you go on to take action based on that. Draw little arrows between them, and you can visualize this loop of learning.

1
- And by the way, trying to explain something in writing is a powerful way to approach learning. Writing can teach us to reflect—it slows us down, shows us what we don’t understand, and makes us aware of the gaps in our knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311990))
1
- Often we get our information from people who are just giving out the recipes. Sometimes the people handing out the recipes haven’t even tried it themselves. When I’m learning, I don’t want the middleman. I want to go direct to the source. I want the details and the stories and the nuances—I want to see how you reflected on your experiences, so when I take away your abstractions, I’ll see just how to put them into practice. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16311993))

- Well, it doesn't matter if you have some extra zeros in your bank account. It doesn't matter if you got that big promotion. It doesn't matter that you were super powerful and you ran a big company. None of that matters—you're not going to be thinking about any of that stuff. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16312095))
1
- What matters is: who's around you? What do people say about you? You’ll be asking yourself, “was I there for people?” Were they there for me? Did I build long-term, sustainable relationships, or did I take advantage of people? Did I live a meaningful life or do I want a do-over? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/16312096))

- The pattern, first described by Clay Christensen in his massively important book The Innovator’s Solution, goes like this:
  When a new technology is invented it tends to be built by one centralized company that has a lot of control, because they need that control to get the system working. But once it’s working, the technology’s architecture becomes stable and gets standardized. Once this happens, an alternate ecosystem can spring up to serve the same job-to-be-done, but in a more open and modular way. Instead of one full-stack company controlling everything from soup to nuts, companies can specialize, focus, build on top of each other, and extend the value in new and unexpected ways.

- The first critique says there are very few human needs that only blockchains can fulfill. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979942))
1
- The second critique appeals to history, and says that blockchain technology has been around for over a decade, and yet all anybody is using it for is financial speculation and money laundering. If web3 is so great, shouldn’t it have been further along by now with real use cases? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979952))
1
- There isn’t much that blockchains enable that would be impossible to implement in a web2 way. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979963))
1
- This process is messy and slower “zero-to-one” innovation, but in the end it wins every time, because open ecosystems are more flexible and extensible than closed ones. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979970))
1
- First, somebody has to figure out how to make the entire system work, end-to-end. This is “zero to one” type innovation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979973))
1
- This is how computers first came to market: IBM built the hardware (storage, memory, CPU, I/O, and everything else), programming language, software, and did customer support. They needed to control all these layers because the optimal architecture had not been discovered yet, and everything depends on everything else. The constraints you encounter when designing CPUs affect the programming language design, the software depends on the language, etc. There are tons of interdependencies. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979981))
1
- But eventually the full-stack player runs out of room for improvement. They get to a point where customers don’t care so much about the changes they make to the system, and they’re not willing to pay more. At this point the architecture reaches a local maximum, and it stabilizes.
  Once stability sets in, the second phase of innovation happens: a new value chain emerges to compete with the full-stack player, but with an open architecture based on well-defined standards. Once the computer industry established the basic requirements of all the components like storage, memory, CPU, and OS, it became possible for independent companies to specialize and just create one component. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979987))
1
- “Modularity has a profound impact on industry structure because it enables independent, nonintegrated organizations to sell, buy, and assemble components and subsystems. Whereas in the interdependent world you had to make all of the key elements of the system in order to make any of them, in a modular world you can prosper by outsourcing or by supplying just one element. Ultimately, the specifications for modular interfaces will coalesce as industry standards. When that happens, companies can mix and match components from best-of-breed suppliers in order to respond conveniently to the specific needs of individual customers.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979992))
1
- (In crypto, this ability for components to work together in an open way is called “composability.”) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17979998))
1
- It seems as though nothing in web3 couldn’t be built in web2 because web3 is in some ways more about re-inventing than inventing. It’s about taking stuff we’ve already figured out and rebuilding it on a more open and modular architecture, so that it can be improved upon and extended in unpredictable ways. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17980010))
1
- It’s taking web3 a long time to gain adoption because there is no single centralized integrator playing the role of IBM. This is why people often complain that crypto is so confusing and hard to get started with. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/17980015))
1
- I like to think about the agency or control that we enjoy with respect to our own states of mind, and my driving interest is the active/passive distinction—the distinction between what we do, and what merely happens to us. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166034))
1
- In my opinion, doing philosophy well is about giving a full hearing to all sides of a debate: doing your best to understand each conflicting point of view, what it has going for it, and where it goes wrong. The aim is to pull the truth out of each of those, add your own insights or creativity, and end up with somewhere you can stand. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166035))
1
- One of the toughest hills to climb in my field is when I have to familiarize myself with an area of inquiry that is entirely new territory for me. My approach to those situations is based on the fact that I realized early on that, for me, it’s essential to figure out—and fast—what the main intuitive problem is in that new area. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166039))
1
- It’s the same with philosophy: I need to know where the intellectual obstacles, stumbling blocks, and puzzles are, and what shapes they take, by trying it out for myself. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166044))
1
- but if I started out by trying to dive into all of the literature first, I’d be completely lost. Nothing would stick, and I wouldn’t learn anything. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166046))
1
- The first thing I do is I make sure I always have something I’m working on. I try to always have at least one, if not two, works in progress which are about the size of a twenty-five-page paper. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166052))
1
- I’m very grateful to be at the point in my career where this happens naturally. I’m often asked to speak or give colloquia—an academic conference or seminar—at various places. The very act of accepting those invitations gives me deadlines to work towards. In turn, those deadlines force me to figure out what I think about different things—and they give me the reason to commit work to paper. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166053))
1
- If you do research in chemistry or neuroscience, you do your lab work and you collect the results. Then you think about your figures, develop the graphs and illustrations you want to use, and finally you write up your text around all of that.
  Philosophy has something like those same stages, but it’s all done in prose. That can be very confusing, and extremely inefficient—when you start to write on a new project, it’s the ideas you need to get at, not their final presentation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166054))
1
- When you start a new paper, you want some thesis that you're going to support, or some conclusion you're going to get to—then you want some arguments that will get you there. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166055))
1
- I usually have at least an idea of the intellectual steps I think will get me to where I want to go. I’ll think, ‘If I had this axiom, and that premise, I think I could get to my conclusion…’ ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166056))
1
- Once it doesn't change—at least twice, maybe three times—then I feel like I'm finally ready to turn on the computer and start writing in prose. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166059))
1
- My current way of doing this is by taking the text I already have, and working backwards from it to create an outline. I paste the entire text into a new document, formatted as an outline in my word processor, and then I just start carving away at it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166065))
1
- I delete excess stuff until I get down to a pretty dense outline—which will also serve as the handout I’ll use when I give a talk on the paper ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/18166067))

- You should not let yourself be delighted with error. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/19584476))

- ‘to shew clearly how this great man, whose mind could grasp such large and extensive subjects, as he has shewn in his literary labours, was yet well-informed in the common affairs of life, and loved to illustrate them.’ ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1343928706/19584484))
