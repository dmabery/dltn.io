A - The One Long Slow Idea Book

1
- I started Sarah Schulman’s [*The Gentrification of the Mind*](https://amzn.to/2YGxPue) this morning, but I had to stop and copy out this passage from her introduction, explaining why she likes to use collage and juxtaposition to build up her text:
  > But as a reader myself, I have always most enjoyed books that I can be interactive with. I like to fiercely agree with one idea—and fiercely disagree with the next. That kind of dynamic relationship requires a lot of ideas coming at once, from which the reader can pick and choose. Nothing bores me more than the one-long-slow-idea book, and I promise to never write one.

  Yes! That’s it! The “One-Long-Slow-Idea Book.” What a snooze.
  I, too, promise never to write one, not on purpose. (Though, I don’t begrudge anyone who does — it can be quite lucrative.)
  I would like to write a One-hundred-Short-Fast-Ideas book. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0znfrmqawv9ta5h81qn3sn))
