B - How We Got to Now

- a mile across the Venetian Lagoon to the island of Murano. Unwittingly, the Venetian doges had created an innovation hub: by concentrating the glassmakers on a single island the size of a small city neighborhood, they triggered a surge of creativity, giving birth to an environment that possessed what economists call “information spillover.” ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=223))

- Most materials absorb the energy of light. On a subatomic level, electrons orbiting the atoms that made up the material effectively “swallow” the energy of the incoming photon of light, causing those electrons to gain energy. But electrons can gain or lose energy only in discrete steps, known as “quanta.” But the size of the steps varies from material to material. Silicon dioxide happens to have very large steps, which means that the energy from a single photon of light is not sufficient to bump up the electrons to the higher level of energy. Instead, the light passes through the material. (Most ultraviolet light, however, does have enough energy to be absorbed, which is why you can’t get a suntan through a glass window.) But light doesn’t simply pass through glass; it can also be bent and distorted or even broken up into its component wavelengths. Glass could be used to change the look of the world, by bending light in precise ways. This turned out to be even more revolutionary than simple transparency.

- Those early spectacles were called roidi da ogli, meaning “disks for the eyes.” Thanks to their resemblance to lentil beans—lentes in Latin—the disks themselves came to be called “lenses.” ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=252))

- What followed was one of the most extraordinary cases of the hummingbird effect in modern history. Gutenberg made printed books relatively cheap and portable, which triggered a rise in literacy, which exposed a flaw in the visual acuity of a sizable part of the population, which then created a new market for the manufacture of spectacles. Within a hundred years of Gutenberg’s invention, thousands of spectacle makers around Europe were thriving, and glasses became the first piece of advanced technology—since the invention of clothing in Neolithic times—that ordinary people would regularly wear on their bodies.

- Hummingbird effects sometimes happen when an innovation in one field exposes a flaw in some other technology (or in the case of the printed book, in our own anatomy) that can be corrected only by another discipline altogether.

- Scientists at Bell Labs then took fibers of this super-clear glass and shot laser beams down the length of them, fluctuating optical signals that corresponded to the zeroes and ones of binary code. This hybrid of two seemingly unrelated inventions—the concentrated, orderly light of lasers, and the hyper-clear glass fibers—came to be known as fiber optics. Using fiber-optic cables was vastly more efficient than sending electrical signals over copper cables, particularly for long distances: light allows much more bandwidth and is far less susceptible to noise and interference than is electrical energy. Today, ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=342))

- It seems impossible, but the fact is that you can hold the entire collection of all the voice and data traffic traveling between North America and Europe in the palm of one hand. A thousand innovations came together to make that miracle possible: we had to invent the idea of digital data itself, and laser beams, and computers at both ends that could transmit and receive those beams of information—not to mention the ships that lay and repair the cables. But those strange bonds of silicon dioxide, once again, turn out to be central to the story. The World Wide Web is woven together out of threads of glass.

- The same holds true for technological advances like the mirror. Without a technology that enabled humans to see a clear reflection of reality, including their own faces, the particular constellation of ideas in art and philosophy and politics that we call the Renaissance would have had a much more difficult time coming into being.

- Today, the summit of Mauna Kea is crowned by thirteen distinct observatories, massive white domes scattered across the red rocks like some gleaming outpost on a distant planet. Included in this group are the twin telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory, the most powerful optical telescopes on earth.

- Lasers are beamed into the night sky above Keck, effectively creating an artificial star in the heavens. That false star becomes a kind of reference point; because the scientists know exactly what the laser should look like in the heavens were there no atmospheric distortion, they are able to get a measurement of the existing distortion by comparing the “ideal” laser image and what the telescopes actually register.

- One reason that evolution didn’t find much use for silicon dioxide is that most of the really interesting things about the substance don’t appear until you get over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=501))
1
- This was the hummingbird effect that the furnace unleashed: by learning how to generate extreme heat in a controlled environment, we unlocked the molecular potential of silicon dioxide, which soon transformed the way we see the world, and ourselves.

- The history of global trade had clearly demonstrated that vast fortunes could be made by transporting a commodity that was ubiquitous in one environment to a place where it was scarce. To the young Tudor, ice seemed to fit the equation perfectly: nearly worthless in Boston, ice would be priceless in Havana. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=541))

- Tudor discovered that sawdust made a brilliant insulator for his ice. Blocks layered on top of each other with sawdust separating them would last almost twice as long as unprotected ice. This was Tudor’s frugal genius: he took three things that the market had effectively priced at zero—ice, sawdust, and an empty vessel—and turned them into a flourishing business.

- Those patents rippling across the planet are an example of one of the great curiosities in the history of innovation: what scholars now call “multiple invention.” Inventions and scientific discoveries tend to come in clusters, where a handful of geographically dispersed investigators stumble independently onto the very same discovery. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=768))

- To imagine a world of flash-frozen food, Birdseye needed to experience the challenges of feeding a family in an arctic climate surrounded by brutal cold; he needed to spend time with the Inuit fishermen; he needed to inspect the foul containers of cod-fishing trawlers in New York harbors; he needed the scientific knowledge of how to produce temperatures well below freezing; he needed the industrial knowledge of how to build a production line. Like every big idea, Birdseye’s breakthrough was not a single insight, but a network of other ideas, packaged together in a new configuration. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=852))

- The story of Carrier’s invention is a classic in the annals of accidental discovery. As a twenty-five-year-old engineer, Carrier had been hired by a printing company in Brooklyn to devise a scheme that would help them keep the ink from smearing in the humid summer months. Carrier’s invention not only removed the humidity from the printing room; it also chilled the air. Carrier noticed that everyone suddenly wanted to have lunch next to the printing presses, and he began to design contraptions that would be deliberately built to regulate the humidity and temperature in an interior space. Within a few years, Carrier had formed a company—still one of the largest air-conditioning manufacturers in the world—that focused on industrial uses for the technology. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=870))

- Within half a decade, Americans were installing more than a million units a year. When we think about twentieth-century miniaturization, our minds naturally gravitate to the transistor or the microchip, but the shrinking footprint of air-conditioning deserves its place in the annals of innovation as well: a machine that had once been larger than a flatbed truck reduced in size so that it could fit in a window. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=901))

- The dream of recording the human voice entered the adjacent possible only after two key developments: one from physics, the other from anatomy. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=994))
1
- In March 1857, two decades before Thomas Edison would invent the phonograph, the French patent office awarded Scott a patent for a machine that recorded sound. Scott’s contraption funneled sound waves through a hornlike apparatus that ended with a membrane of parchment. Sound waves would trigger vibrations in the parchment, which would then be transmitted to a stylus made of pig’s bristle. The stylus would etch out the waves on a page darkened by the carbon of lampblack. He called his invention the “phonautograph”: the self-writing ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1006))
1
- Fifteen years after his patent, another inventor was experimenting with the phonautograph, modifying Scott’s original design to include an actual ear from a cadaver in order to understand the acoustics better. Through his tinkering, he hit upon a method for both capturing and transmitting sound. His name was Alexander Graham Bell. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1055))
1
- Bell, in inventing the telephone, made what was effectively a mirror-image miscalculation: He envisioned one of the primary uses for the telephone to be as a medium for sharing live music. An orchestra or singer would sit on one end of the line, and listeners would sit back and enjoy the sound through the telephone speaker on the other. So, the two legendary inventors had it exactly reversed: people ended up using the phonograph to listen to music and using the telephone to communicate with friends. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1062))
1
- It was not just the diversity of talent, and the tolerance of failure, and the willingness to make big bets—all of which were traits that Bell Labs shared with Edison’s famous lab at Menlo Park as well as other research labs around the world. What made Bell Labs fundamentally different had as much to do with antitrust law as the geniuses it attracted. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1093))
1
- Eventually, the antitrust lawyers in the Justice Department worked out an intriguing compromise, settled officially in 1956. AT&T would be allowed to maintain its monopoly over phone service, but any patented invention that had originated in Bell Labs would have to be freely licensed to any American company that found it useful, and all new patents would have to be licensed for a modest fee. Effectively, the government said to AT&T that it could keep its profits, but it would have to give away its ideas in return. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1104))

- One of those tinkerers was Lee De Forest, one of the most brilliant and erratic inventors of the twentieth century. Working out of his home lab in Chicago, De Forest dreamed of combining Marconi’s wireless telegraph with Bell’s telephone.

- It was caused by sound waves from the loud noise of the spark. Gas didn’t detect and amplify a radio signal at all; in fact, it made the device less effective. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1187))

- Television, radar, sound recording, guitar amplifiers, X-rays, microwave ovens, the “secret telephony” of SIGSALY, the first digital computers—all would rely on vacuum tubes. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1192))
1
- Something about radio and music seems to have encouraged this pattern, in a way that television or film did not: almost immediately after a national medium emerged for sharing music, subcultures of sound began flourishing on that medium. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1217))

- The radio signals were color-blind. Like the Internet, they didn’t break down barriers as much as live in a world separate from them. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1227))

- 1901, a Boston-based firm called the Submarine Signal Company began manufacturing a system of communications tools that exploited this property of aquatic sound waves: underwater bells that chimed at regular intervals, and microphones specially designed for underwater reception called “hydrophones.” ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1304))

- They found that clean drinking water led to a 43 percent reduction in total mortality in the average American city. Even more impressive, chlorine and filtration systems reduced infant mortality by 74 percent, and child mortality by almost as much. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1609))
1
- This is the full circle of clean: some of the most brilliant ideas in science and engineering in the nineteenth century helped us purify water that was too dirty to drink. And now, a hundred and fifty years later, we’ve created water that’s too clean to drink. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1729))

- Increasingly obsessed with the science of dynamics, the study of how objects move through space, he decided to build a pendulum that would re-create what he had observed in the Duomo of Pisa so many years before. ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1775))
1
- Fifty-eight years in the making, his slow hunch about the pendulum’s “magical property” had finally begun to take shape. The idea lay at the intersection point of multiple disciplines and interests: Galileo’s memory of the altar lamp, his studies of motion and the moons of Jupiter, the rise of a global shipping industry, and its new demand for clocks that would be accurate to the second. Physics, astronomy, maritime navigation, and the daydreams of a college student: all these different strains converged in Galileo’s mind. ([Location 1804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1804))
1
- The British historian E. P. Thompson, in a brilliant essay on time and industrialization published in the late 1960s, noted that in the literature of the period, one of the telltale signs that a character has raised himself a rung or two up the socioeconomic ladder is the acquisition of a pocket watch. ([Location 1809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1809))
1
- With watches spiking in popularity across the country, a Minnesota railroad agent named Richard Warren Sears stumbled across a box of unwanted watches from a local jeweler, and turned a tidy profit selling them to other station agents. Inspired by his success, he partnered with a Chicago businessman named Alvah Roebuck, and together they launched a mail-order publication showcasing a range of watch designs: the Sears, Roebuck catalog. Those fifteen pounds of mail-order catalogs currently weighing down your mailbox? They all started with the must-have gadget of the late nineteenth century: the consumer-grade pocket watch.

- Allen designed the map so that the divisions between time zones zigzagged slightly to correspond to the points where the major railroad lines connected, instead of having the divisions run straight down meridian lines.

- In fact, each leap forward in our ability to measure time has involved a handoff from one discipline to another. The shift from sundials to pendulum clocks relied on a shift from astronomy to dynamics, the physics of motion. The next revolution in time would depend on electromechanics.

- For the first few decades after Marrison’s invention, quartz clocks became the de facto timekeeping devices for scientific or industrial use; standard U.S. time was kept by quartz clocks starting in the 1930s. But by the 1970s, the technology had gotten cheap enough for a mass market, with the emergence of the first quartz-based wristwatches. Today, just about every consumer appliance that has a clock on it—microwaves, alarm clocks, wristwatches, automobile clocks—all run on the equal time of quartz piezoelectricity.

- Studying the behavior of electrons orbiting within a cesium atom, Bohr noticed that they moved with an astonishing regularity. Untroubled by the chaotic drag of mountain ranges or tides, the electrons tapped out a rhythm that was several orders of magnitude more reliable than the earth’s rotation.

- Those satellites are sending out the most elemental of signals, again and again, in perpetuity: the time is 11:48:25.084738 . . . the time is 11:48:25.084739. . . . When your phone tries to figure out its location, it pulls down at least three of these time stamps from satellites, each reporting a slightly different time thanks to the duration it takes the signal to travel from satellite to the GPS receiver in your hand. A satellite reporting a later time is closer than one reporting an earlier time. Since the satellites have perfectly predictable locations, the phone can calculate its exact position by triangulating among the three different time stamps. ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1992))

- Like the naval navigators of the eighteenth century, GPS determines your location by comparing clocks. This is in fact one of the recurring stories of the history of the clock: each new advance in timekeeping enables a corresponding advance in our mastery of geography—from ships, to railroads, to air traffic, to GPS. It’s an idea that Einstein would have appreciated: measuring time turns out to be key to measuring space. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00INIXU5I&location=1997))

- Embedded in your ability to tell the time is the understanding of how electrons circulate within cesium atoms; the knowledge of how to send microwave signals from satellites and how to measure the exact speed with which they travel; the ability to position satellites in reliable orbits above the earth, and of course the actual rocket science needed to get them off the ground; the ability to trigger steady vibrations in a block of silicon dioxide—not to mention all the advances in computation and microelectronics and network science necessary to process and represent that information on your phone. You don’t need to know any of these things to tell the time now, but that’s the way progress works: the more we build up these vast repositories of scientific and technological understanding, the more we conceal them.

- If we think that innovation comes from a lone genius inventing a new technology from scratch, that model naturally steers us toward certain policy decisions, like stronger patent protection. But if we think that innovation comes out of collaborative networks, then we want to support different policies and organizational forms: less rigid patent laws, open standards, employee participation in stock plans, cross-disciplinary connections.

- BUT IF SIMULTANEOUS INVENTION is the rule, what about the exceptions? What about Babbage and Lovelace, who were effectively a century ahead of just about every other human being on the planet? Most innovation happens in the present tense of the adjacent possible, working with the tools and concepts that are available in that time. But every now and then, some individual or group makes a leap that seems almost like time traveling. How do they do it? What allows them to see past the boundaries of the adjacent possible when their contemporaries fail to do so? That may be the greatest mystery of all.

- If there is a common thread to the time travelers, beyond the nonexplanation of genius, it is this: they worked at the margins of their official fields, or at the intersection point between very different disciplines.
