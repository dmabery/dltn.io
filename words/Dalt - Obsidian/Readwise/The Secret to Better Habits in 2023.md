- Me personally, I try to get some exercise in the morning and I *for sure* write in the morning. My assistant knows not to schedule calls or meetings in the morning because they make it too easy to let the day get away from you. They sap your willpower early. By tackling writing first, by getting some time outside (with the kids usually) first, I have already won the day and everything else is extra from there. Well-intentioned plans fall apart.

- The famous line from Musonius Rufus was that labor passes quickly but the fruit of labor endures. [It’s the same with discipline](https://store.dailystoic.com/pages/discipline-is-destiny): the vigilance is temporary, but the fruit of that vigilance can be enjoyed long after the sacrifice has been forgotten. When you’re on the fence about going for a long run or working on a big project, remind yourself: *discipline now, freedom later. The labor will pass, and the rewards will last.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvpn6y3hjnc9nf3rdc2nn6f))

- Samuel Johnson wrote in his diary near the end of 1775 with a New Year on the horizon,
  > *“When I look back on resolutions of improvement and amendment which have year after year been made and broken, either by negligence, forgetfulness, vicious idleness, casual interruption, or morbid infirmity; when I find that so much of my life has stolen unprofitably away, and that I can descry by retrospection scarcely a few single days properly and vigorously employed, why do I yet try to resolve again? I try because reformation is necessary and despair is criminal.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvpr73bq5af0055r728k83a))

We were “jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances,” as Marcus said. But now it’s time to pick ourselves up and try again. It’s time, Marcus continues, to “revert at once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better group of harmony if you keep on going back to it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvprz8jyf7h3mr141t698ax))

  > *From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer…* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvpsmbp7nhdns93c6q85489))
