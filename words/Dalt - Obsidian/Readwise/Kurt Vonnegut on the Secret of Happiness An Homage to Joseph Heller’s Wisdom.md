A - Kurt Vonnegut on the Secret of Happiness: An Homage to Joseph Heller’s Wisdom

1
- JOE HELLER
  True story, Word of Honor: 
  Joseph Heller, an important and funny writer 
  now dead, 
  and I were at a party given by a billionaire 
  on Shelter Island.
  I said, “Joe, how does it make you feel 
  to know that our host only yesterday 
  may have made more money 
  than your novel ‘Catch-22’ 
  has earned in its entire history?” 
  And Joe said, “I’ve got something he can never have.” 
  And I said, “What on earth could that be, Joe?” 
  And Joe said, “The knowledge that I’ve got enough.” 
  Not bad! Rest in peace! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h49sw6k4msw4jbqeqz13sv65))
