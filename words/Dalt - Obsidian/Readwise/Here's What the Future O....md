- Here's what the future of education looks like: 
  1. Teaching will become an extremely lucrative profession. Salaries will follow a power law. The best teachers will make millions of dollars per year and teach thousands of students every year. In fact, this is already happening. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992035665072128))

- 2. Mass market courses will have Hollywood-level production budgets.
  People who teach mass-market subjects like statistics and economics will attract millions of students. Teaching at scale will give them the financial resources to invest in high-end graphics and production. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992038542364672))

- 3. Classes will be big and small.
  The education industry is obsessed with the "average class size metric." People think that smaller is always better. Not true. You want scale when you're delivering lectures so you can invest in production. At other times, you want small groups. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992041306411008))

- 4. Subjects will cross-pollinate.
  Academia is fragmented. Departments are sorted into distinct subjects with very little overlap. But the Internet is multi-disciplinary by nature. Unconstrained by the divisions of academia, teachers will create their own disciplines of study. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992044083113985))

- 5. Community learning will make a comeback.
  So far, online education has been great for self-motivated learners. But most people need a social group to hold them accountable. The top schools of tomorrow will build strong communities and alumni networks, just like a university. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992046897479684))

- 6. The price of education will fall.
  Learning isn't expensive. Credentials are. The more self-driven you are, the less you'll pay for your education. We’ll look back at the present day and laugh about the predatory and prohibitive cost of college.

- 7. Students will become producers.
  The pure sit-back-and-listen style of modern education needs to go. Students will learn by building and creating things. Every student now has a smartphone in their pocket with an HD camera and the ability to reach anybody on planet earth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992052756922368))

- 8. School will escape the classroom.
  We’ve reached peak time in classroom, listening to the drone of a lecture. The Internet is a classroom without walls — a portal to the entire world. Education apps will allow students to spend less time in a formal education environment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992055634153474))
1
- 9. Student evaluations will become meaningful.
  The majority of colleges don’t take student evaluations seriously. Tomorrow’s schools will be measured on the empirical success of students. As the availability of options increases, teachers will have to make learning enjoyable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992058650083329))

- 10. Online education will invert the learning process.
  In school, you start with the basics and expand towards curiosity. But on the Internet, you start with curiosity and expand towards the basics. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1493992061535539207))
