B - Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow

1
- A truly magnificent thing about the way the brain was coded, Sam thought, was that it could say “Excuse me” while meaning “Screw you.” ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=88))
1
- Sam looked at Sadie, and he thought, This is what time travel is. It’s looking at a person, and seeing them in the present and the past, concurrently. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=163))
1
- And yet, he knew himself and he knew he was the type of person that never called anyone, unless he was absolutely certain the advance would be welcomed. His brain was treacherously negative. He would invent that she had been cold toward him, that she hadn’t even had a class that day, that she had simply wanted to get away from Sam. His brain would insist that if she’d wanted to see him, she would have given him a way to contact her. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=196))
1
- Anders Larsson, who would go on to win a Fields Medal, had said as much in that afternoon’s meeting. His parting words: “You’re incredibly gifted, Sam. But it is worth noting that to be good at something is not quite the same as loving it.” ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=221))
1
- “Possibly.” Sam avoided a direct admission of ignorance. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=328))
1
- “No,” Sam said, “but my grandfather has a Donkey Kong machine in his restaurant. He lets me play as much as I want for free. And the thing about games is, if you get good at one game, you can be good at any game. That’s what I think. They’re all hand-eye coordination and observing patterns.” ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=346))
1
- To allow yourself to play with another person is no small risk. It means allowing yourself to be open, to be exposed, to be hurt. It is the human equivalent of the dog rolling on its back—I know you won’t hurt me, even though you can. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=401))
1
- “There is no more intimate act than play, even sex.” ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=404))
1
- “Friendship is friendship, and charity is charity,” Freda said. “You know very well that I was in Germany as a child, and you have heard the stories, so I won’t tell them to you again. But I can tell you that the people who give you charity are never your friends. It is not possible to receive charity from a friend.” ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=437))
1
- “Mine Sadie. This life is filled with inescapable moral compromises. We should do what we can to avoid the easy ones.” ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=440))
1
- The idea of Solution was that if you asked questions and didn’t keep mindlessly building widgets, your score would be lower, but you would find out you were working in a factory that supplied machine parts to the Third Reich. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=573))
1
- The idea of Solution was that if you won the game on points, you lost it morally. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=578))
1
- Maybe she had been like the player in Solution. Maybe she hadn’t asked the right or enough questions because she hadn’t wanted to know the answers. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=603))
1
- “There are people like you and like me. We have bad things happen to us, and we survive them. We are sturdy. But with people like your friend, you must be exceptionally gentle, or they may break.” ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=750))
1
- Life is very long, she thought, unless it is not. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=785))
1
- “You aren’t just a gamer when you play anymore. You’re a builder of worlds, and if you’re a builder of worlds, your feelings are not as important as what your gamers are feeling. You must imagine them at all times. There is no artist more empathetic than the game designer.” ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=813))
1
- Sam fully got what she was trying to do, but he also believed that she would have to do more if she were to make games that people loved, not just games that people admired. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=863))
1
- “Her parents can buy her anything she wants. Why would she want some dumb thing I drew on the back of an envelope?” Sam said. “I suppose,” Dong Hyun said, “because her parents can buy her anything she wants.” ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=949))
1
- “Because,” he said. Click on this word, he thought, and you will find links to everything it means. ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1039))
1
- “Promise me, we won’t ever do this again,” Sadie said. “Promise me, that no matter what happens, no matter what dumb thing we supposedly perpetrate on each other, we won’t ever go six years without talking to each other. Promise me you’ll always forgive me, and I promise I’ll always forgive you.” These, of course, are the kinds of vows young people feel comfortable making when they have no idea what life has in store for them. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1060))
1
- But this was classic Sam—he had learned to tolerate the sometimes-painful present by living in the future. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1104))
1
- There is a time for any fledgling artist where one’s taste exceeds one’s abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anyway. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1161))
1
- Sam’s grandfather had two core beliefs: (1) all things were knowable by anyone, and (2) anything was fixable if you took the time to figure out what was broken. Sam believed these things as well. ([Location 1654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1654))
1
- You have this purity thing, but seriously, no one will care. There is no purity in art. The process of how you arrive at something doesn’t matter at all. The game is going to be completely original because we made it. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1674))
1
- Weltschmerz ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1754))

- “Hi,” Sam said, without looking at her. “You can watch if you want. I’m going to play until the end of this life.” “That’s a good philosophy,” Anna said. ([Location 1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=1877))

- raconteur? ([Location 2237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=2237))

- She liked going to bed early and waking up early. She liked working. She liked that she was good at her work, and she felt proud of the fact that she was well paid for it. She felt pleasure in orderly things—a perfectly efficient section of code, a closet where every item was in its place. She liked solitude and the thoughts of her own interesting and creative mind. She liked to be comfortable. ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=2288))
1
- If she were cautious in her life, she could avoid compromising in her work. ([Location 2297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=2297))
1
- On the night Sam went missing, it occurred to Sadie that nothing in life was as solid-state as it appeared. A childish game might be deadly. A friend might disappear. And as much as a person might try to shield herself from it, the possibility for the other outcome was always there. We are all living, at most, half of a life, she thought. There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen. ([Location 2350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=2350))
1
- “The key to getting what you want in a hospital is telling the right lies in an authoritative voice.” ([Location 2697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=2697))
1
- The man in the other car walked toward Sam in a daze. He called to them desperately. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t see you there. I didn’t see you. Is everyone okay? Is everyone okay? Is anyone alive? Anyone?” Sam opened his eyes: “I’m here.” These were the last words he would say until the day he encountered Sadie Green in the game room. ([Location 2886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=2886))

    - Note: This entire passage was written masterfully. I cried.

- If Anna finds the emergency lights. If Anna never sleeps with George. If Sam is never born. There are, he determines, infinite ways his mother doesn’t die that night and only one way she does. ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=2894))

    - Note: Frick…. That is SUCH a hard thing to think about…
1
- By the time it was over, Sam’s pain had abated somewhat, and he could speak more easily; he turned to Marx. “It’s called phantom limb pain. I think my foot is still there, and when I put on the prosthetic, sometimes, I think it’s being crushed. I can feel my bones crumbling, and my flesh turning to liquid. They say it’s all in my head.” Marx thought about this. “But what pain isn’t?” ([Location 3077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=3077))
1
- Sam knew the foot was gone. He could see it was gone. He knew what he was experiencing was a basic error in programming, and he wished he could open up his brain and delete the bad code. Unfortunately, the human brain is every bit as closed a system as a Mac. ([Location 3116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=3116))
1
- “I think you mean a public failure. ([Location 3592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=3592))
1
- “You go back to work. You take advantage of the quiet time that a failure allows you. You remind yourself that no one is paying any attention to you and it’s a perfect time for you to sit down in front of your computer and make another game. You try again. You fail better.” ([Location 3595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=3595))

- And if they can be, shouldn’t they be?” ([Location 4130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=4130))
1
- Sam used to say that Marx was the most fortunate person he had ever met—he was lucky with lovers, in business, in looks, in life. But the longer Sadie knew Marx, the more she thought Sam hadn’t truly understood the nature of Marx’s good fortune. Marx was fortunate because he saw everything as if it were a fortuitous bounty. It was impossible to know—were persimmons his favorite fruit, or had they just now become his favorite fruit because there they were, growing in his own backyard? ([Location 4357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=4357))
1
- Torschlusspanik?” Sam said. “It means ‘gate-shut panic,’ ” Simon said. “It’s the fear that time is running out and that you’re going to miss an opportunity. Literally, the gate is closing, and you’ll never get in.” ([Location 4409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=4409))
1
- ‘Zweisamkeit’ is the feeling of being alone even when you’re with other people.” ([Location 4434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=4434))
1
- Video games don’t make people violent, but maybe they falsely give you the idea that you can be a hero. Without warning, your mind flies away again. — ([Location 4887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=4887))
1
- The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time. ([Location 4898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=4898))

- “I liked the game a lot,” Destiny (Ume no Destiny) began. “I liked the idea of it, and I like that the game is political. But if I had a critique, it’s that the game is too nihilistic. After you figure out what the factory is making, the game gets…” Destiny searched for the right word. “…well, repetitive, I guess. It should move on to a different part of the game instead.” “You know, Destiny, you’re not the first person to say that. That’s very astute, and I think if I’d had more time, I would have done exactly what you said. But sometimes, you have to make your game in the time that you have.

Upon the person’s death, your brain still believes the virtual person exists, because, in a sense, the person still does.

- “You’re probably right.” Sam turned to face Sadie. “You know what I keep thinking? I keep thinking how easy it was to make that first Ichigo. We were like machines then—this, this, this, this. It’s so easy to make a hit when you’re young and you don’t know anything.” “I think that, too,” Sadie said. “The knowledge ([Location 6347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=6347))

- We couldn’t have done as much as we did on our own. We could never have made a game that we could sell to a company like Opus on the resources we had.

And I think, because of the internet, we would have been overwhelmed by how many people ([Location 6390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JBCGQB8&location=6390))
