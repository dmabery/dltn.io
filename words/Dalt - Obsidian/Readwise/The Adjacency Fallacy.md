A - The Adjacency Fallacy

1
- The sticking point tends to be something I call the adjacency fallacy: the idea that the roles that suit your personality and soft-skill strengths are likely to be socially adjacent to the one you are leaving behind. “Nearby” roles in some sense. What sense precisely, we’ll get to. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557086869/21405133))

- Career paths viewed in terms of pure physics and geometry, the way Bruce Willis views the Nakatomi building in are a case of what D&G call a smooth space. That’s like moving through visible pathways and through invisible ones, like air ducts, sewers, storm drains and such. Also simply creating a path by busting through walls when there are no visible or invisible paths, faking ids and so forth. Besides McLane, I’m told the Israeli military thinks of military tactics this way. As do Jason Bourne and James Bond 2.0. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557086869/21405139))

- Here’s the difference between striated and smooth career-spaces: navigating the former just takes intelligence. Navigating the latter takes intelligence, creativity and balls. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557086869/21405143))

- Short of somehow engineering a major regrade to level hills, you can’t choose to disobey the law of gravity: climbing is work, even if you use an elevator to do it.
  Status works kinda like that. Short of an actual flattening of society through a systemic increase in egalitarianism, things valued in terms of status take a minimum amount of vertical climbing work that you cannot avoid. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557086869/21407869))

- It’s not quite Die Hard, but transitioning to blogging from any old-economy role requiring skilled writing (professional analyst, academic researcher, journalist, novelist) involves exactly the same writing skills, but different understandings of what is valuable. Informality becomes a virtue, formality a vice. Writing in a personal, somewhat confessional tone becomes a virtue, writing with distant authority a vice. Self-deprecation becomes a virtue, gravitas a vice. Participating in discussions as an equal becomes a virtue, assuming authority in discussions becomes a vice.

- I don’t know anybody who can write skillfully in formal, impersonal, authoritative ways, full of gravitas, but cannot turn all those things around at a skill level. What they struggle with is learning to flip values on their head. They already know how to turn a formal, academic sentence into an informal blogging sentence. What they struggle with is why they should do it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557086869/21407914))

- An MBA may well have excellent statistics skills, domain knowledge of an industry and visibility into lots of opportunities. But to make the mind-shift into entrepreneurship, he has to learn to see MBAs still jungle-gymming in the old economy with contempt instead of reverence; their priorities as perverse instead of appropriate; their suits as empty.

- A paycheck-employee-turned-lifestyle-businessperson may be doing new work that is indistinguishable from old work at the level of skills. But to make the shift, he has to learn to see paycheck jobs as stifling prisons, conference-attending as stimulating rather than tedious, selling as a rewarding challenge instead of grubby, menial work.

- For the priceless things in life, you need a clear sense of up. For everything else, there are simply offers you can and cannot refuse. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1557086869/21408058))
