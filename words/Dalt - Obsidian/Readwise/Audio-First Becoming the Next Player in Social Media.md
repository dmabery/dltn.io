A - Audio-First: Becoming the Next Player in Social Media

1
- With a still uncertain future, new types of digital interaction aren’t just a novelty, they’re a necessity.
1
- Namely, we’ve cycled through phases of decentralization and centralization of the creation, distribution, consumption, and monetization of information.
1
- The start of social media can be traced back to the age of mass media in the latter half of the 20th century, which was characterized by large media organizations serving as the primary creators of content.
1
- So while consumers became less reliant on central entities to provide information, algorithms leveraged these feedback loops to personalize content for both creators and consumers.
1
- For the first 10–15 years of the millennium, as social media became the gathering place for the world at large, the technology of intimate, synchronous conversations stagnated.
1
- ccording to the New York Times, “Verizon said it was now handling an average of 800 million wireless calls a day during the week, more than double the number made on Mother’s Day, historically one of the busiest call days of the year…In contrast, internet traffic is up around 20 percent to 25 percent from typical daily patterns”.
1
- First, phone calls had deeply embedded the idea that audio’s primary role was synchronous, 1-to-1 communication. Second, users can’t skim audio in the same way that they can skim text or quickly glance at images/videos. This made audio a bad match for mass social media where users became used to scrolling through and briefly looking at a large quantity of content.

- Midas compared the impact of Airpods to what front-facing camera did for selfie culture.
1
- Liquidity refers to the requirement that a user is able to interact with someone else roughly when they are available.
1
- If a user cannot consistently interact with someone else when they are available, a platform has low liquidity.
1
- if a user can consistently find someone else to interact with, but if the interaction is consistently irrelevant, the platform will deliver a poor experience with high liquidity and low familiarity.
1
- a weak-tied group includes people who gather and might not have pre-existing ties to each other, whereas a strong-tied group hosts people who have existing, close relationships with each other.
1
- This strategy is reminiscent of how Facebook onboarded one university at a time so that students would join with their existing communities and peers. This allowed for a base of liquidity and familiarity, which automatically made its experience more sticky.
1
- Facebook observed that to get users to stick, it just had to get any individual to 7 friends in 10 days.
1
- As innovation in audio accelerates, there are many remaining questions: what is audio-first doing well that other social platforms can not? Looking ahead to the future, what are the additional opportunities for social audio?
1
- we’re seeing audio-first social serving users based on relevance or familiarity: either they (1) serve niche communities with relevant, shared interests whether it be a topical interest or a functional interest (Clubhouse, QuarantineChat), or they (2) serve small groups with people that are familiar with each other (Rodeo, Chalk, Cappuccino).
1
- Similarly, our always-on Airpods create a platform for new forms of content. In contrast to long-form podcasts, the frictionless experience of Airpods will allow users to seamlessly consume bite-sized audio clips.
