T - School Is an Astonishing...

1
- School is an astonishing failure of modern society.
  We're taught to memorize textbooks before learning how to function as humans.
  Thread: Life lessons I wish school taught us. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281208296525833))
1
- Schools barely teach us to: 
  • Think critically 
  • Nurture curiosity
  • Have hard convos
  • Sustain relationships
  • Navigate mental health
  They're really good at making us: 
  • Conform or get bullied
  • Only learn from authorities
  • Memorize trivia to pass fake tests ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281209277890560))
1
- Some parts of the world and some schools partially do what I'll suggest, e.g. Montessori.
  But the majority of schools don't—and millions of parents are clueless about how much better schooling must be. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281210309746689))

- What keeps bad schooling alive?
  Parents need a full-time babysitting service while they work 9-5. 
  And so school has become Maximum Security Babysitting:

- Some obvious ways school is broken: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281214617300994))
1
- Fast technology changes make it hard to predict the future job market.
  Yet textbooks are training us to memorize rote information for last decade's jobs. 
  But, with the Internet, info is *no longer* hard to come by!
  In 2021, kids need to learn to NAVIGATE information overload. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281215519019011))
1
- "It baffles me that we have the information available to learn anything for free, but you still have to pay $30,000 to hear some professor explain everything so poorly that you end up learning it all from the Internet anyways." 
  —TakeforGranted ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281216529944582))
1
- Schools overly focus on topical facts—then leave us to figure out society on our own.
  Huh.
  I can easily master grammar and history on YouTube.
  But navigating mental health, relationships, and society is hard with just videos. We need caring, in-person mentors—who we pay well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281217440100353))
1
- Another sneaky problem with schools is they teach us *consumption over creation:* ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281218476093449))
1
- "It's sad that smart kids want to be YouTube creators."
  No, it's not. It's sad when kids want to be poker players or day traders—adding 0 value to the world.
  Creators master writing, marketing, storytelling. 
  This trains them to be lifelong makers—not just passive consumers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281219302277128))
1
- Now, here are some adulthood realizations I wish school taught me: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281220346753033))
1
- Many relationship troubles emerge from one root cause: assuming bad intent. 
  One of the highest ROI things we can teach our children: start by assuming good intent.
  Train your reflex to ask questions before making assumptions. 
  Lead with curiosity—not critique. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281221772722176))
1
- The history taught in school is often pop history. 
  Trivia and memorization.
  Instead, focus on *practical history:*
  Meaning, which events from the past are relevant to life today? What are the patterns?
  What lessons do they teach us about humanity going forward? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281222804529158))
1
- Instead of teaching us to identify truth, schools train us to outsource our thinking to authorities:
  • Institutions
  • Journalists
  • Teachers
  • Politicians
  Authorities DON'T have a moral high ground over you. They're human—corruptible.
  Crosscheck critical info for yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281223853105157))
1
- What kids must understand about the news:
  • Fake news travels faster than true news.
  • For-profit news (nearly all mainstream news) exists to make money, not to maximize truth.
  • Bad news makes more profit than good news.
  • Journalists are everyday people with biases too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281224872316930))
1
- You can engage with crowds in two ways:
  1. Physical: Sports, music, social gatherings. These are good for you.
  2. Intellectual: This is dangerous. You get dumber by joining a crowd's thinking.
  Key: Engage with groups physically but avoid them intellectually. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281225849679874))
1
- If you go to college, which isn't a must, keep in mind that deciding your life trajectory at the age of 17 is absolutely insane.
  Most kids have no idea what's right for them until they've experienced the real world.
  And college is a bubble—not a substitute for reality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281226822672393))
1
- Before I wrap up, I should point out: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281227829297156))
1
- Teaching has the potential to be the highest-leverage job in the world: 
  If you help kids think independently + navigate society...
  ...you structurally address the world's problems by preparing the next generation *to be better and more rational than our generation.* ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281228718583815))
1
- Yet we pay teachers terribly.
  Teachers who pay out of pocket to cover class materials because schools/parents can't afford them...
  ...they are absolute heroes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281229750341634))
1
- "A survey of 3,500 teachers in the UK found 68% seriously considered quitting and 48% had visited a doctor in the last 12 months for physical or mental issues related to their work."

1
- My silly list of schooling suggestions here could go on infinitely. 
  I am NOT an expert. These are armchair notes-to-self.
  However, there ARE brilliant people whose lives' work is to reverse engineer how to improve childhood education. 
  But, guess what?
  We don't consult them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281231855923205))
1
- Why hasn't schooling improved yet? 
  Maybe:
  1. Awareness: Those in power don't realize how bad it is, don't want to shake things up, or lack imagination.
  2. Politics: It's not pressing. Voters care about the cost of education—less so what's taught or how effective teaching is. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1397281232833191939))
