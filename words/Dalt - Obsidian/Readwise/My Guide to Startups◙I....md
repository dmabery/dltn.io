  Read this to become better:
1

  Drugs can kill you or save your life
  Use accordingly.

  The best startup revenge is overwhelming product/market fit

  Entrepreneurship is a marathon not a sprint. Be sustainable
  Find your gardening.

  With the internet, you are more powerful than you think you are
  1) Learn anything you want
  2) Connect with anyone you want
  3) Be anyone you want
  What a time to be alive
1
- Startup life is a life full of rejection
  No rejection, no progress
1
- How to learn quickly:
  Ask questions. You almost never learn while you are talking

- Recruiting is not hiring
  Recruiting is actively seeking the best people to create the best possible team
  Hiring is pulling the trigger
  Founders should always be recruiting

- Most sales people stop after one or two rejections. Go until two or three
  I bet your sales go up
  Lesson: try and try some more
1
- A good job interview is the same as a good therapy session
  Ask questions & learn
1
- To-do lists are overrated
  A “not to-do” list is more effective than a to-do list. Keeps you from being exceptional
  Focus is the holy grail
1
- Quincy Jones would talk to every person at a book signing and leave a personalized note even if it took him until 3 AM to get home
  He understood the power of making people feel heard
  Personalization is the secret weapon to build loyalty for your customers & team

  A single viral tweet can change your life forever (h/t @sweatystartup)

  Tip: use a password manager like @1Password 
  Saves time and gives you peace of mind

- When dealing with someone upset, think:
  Have they slept, eaten, or been bothered by someone?
  Sensitivity to people is a superpower
1
- How to build relationships:
  - Don’t dismiss people
  - Don’t be a jerk
  - Don’t rush
  - Don’t interrupt
  Be positive & kind
1
- Fear kills startups & dreams. Don't let it!
  Stressed is the word that high achievers use for fear
  Never be fearful, OK to be stressed sometimes
  Tip: Master micro-bravery. conquer fear by breaking it down into smaller steps
1
- Many team issues are like cavities: long term that people never can address the main issue
  Band-aids never work. Address main issues
  You can’t fix something that starts with a poor foundation
1
- Good questions to ask yourself everyday before bed:
  - What have you done today to help someone
  - What is something nice that someone has done for you
  - What did you learn
  - What can I do to be better tomorrow?
