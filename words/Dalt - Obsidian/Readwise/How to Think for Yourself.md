A - How to Think for Yourself

1
- You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn't ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724005))
1
- I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid, because it's one of the most important things to think about when you're deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently from everyone else? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724009))
1
- onventional-minded people don't like to think of themselves as conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them as if they make up their own minds about everything. It's just a coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers'. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724018))
1
- One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're supposed to conform to. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724025))

- The problem with high school is that they haven't yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an inward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both of which magnify the forces of conformism. And so high school is often a bad time for the independent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation that makes you think "this is like high school," you know you should get out. [] ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724039))
1
- Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are thrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup wouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted.

1
- You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space, by reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learn what happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who lived in the past. How did things look to them? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724061))
1
- When you hear someone say something, stop and ask yourself "Is that true?" Don't say it out loud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724063))
1
- reat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724065))
1
- You may not care much what you wear, but there are intellectual fashions too, and you definitely don't want to participate in those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own thoughts, but because unfashionable ideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting. The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is looking. [] ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724069))
1
- at the individual muscles we need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has three components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told what to think, and curiosity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724073))
1
- Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things that are false. It means being careful about degree of belief. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724077))
1
- It's not enough just to have resistance to being told what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideas only to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724084))
1
- They're willing to have anything in their heads, from highly speculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects they care about, everything has to be labelled with a carefully considered degree of belief. [] ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724086))
1
- The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being told what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even this is often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to think of it as a merely negative quality. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724091))
1
- In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a positive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an active delight in ideas that subvert the conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724092))
1
- But while not identical, the two are close enough that there is a definite correlation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded â€” just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded. [] ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724098))
1
- The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be the most interesting. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724105))
1
- Everyone I know who's independent-minded is deeply curious, and everyone I know who's conventional-minded isn't. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724108))
1
- The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724110))
1
- f you're sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724112))
1
- Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to avoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you're currently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is "not much," maybe you should change something. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724120))
1
- Another way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, by investigating things you're interested in. Curiosity is unlike most other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase rather than to sate it. Questions lead to more questions. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724127))
1
- Perhaps, if your goal is to discover novel ideas, your motto should not be "do what you love" so much as "do what you're curious about." ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365437169/14724131))
