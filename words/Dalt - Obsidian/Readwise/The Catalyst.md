B - The Catalyst

1
- Instructing jurors to disregard inadmissible testimony can encourage them to weigh it more heavily. Alcohol prevention messages can lead college students to drink more. And trying to persuade people that smoking is bad for their health can actually make them more interested in smoking in the future.

- People have a need for freedom and autonomy. To feel that their lives and actions are within their personal control. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=292))
1
- People like to feel they have control over their choices and actions. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=308))
1
- Restriction generates a psychological phenomenon called reactance. An unpleasant state that occurs when people feel their freedom is lost or threatened. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=317))
1
- To avoid reactance and the persuasion radar, then, catalysts allow for agency. They stop trying to persuade and instead get people to persuade themselves. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=355))
1
- To reduce reactance, catalysts allow for agency—not by telling people what to do or by being completely hands-off, but by finding the middle ground. By guiding their path. Four key ways to do that are: (1) Provide a menu, (2) ask, don’t tell, (3) highlight a gap, and (4) start with understanding.

- teeth? Guided choices like these let children retain a sense of freedom and control while helping parents reach their desired outcomes.13 ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=407))
1
- It’s providing a menu: a limited set of options from which people can choose. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=415))
1
- Advertising agencies do something similar when presenting work to clients. If the agency shares only one idea, the client spends the entire meeting poking holes in the presentation, looking for flaws or listing reasons why it won’t work. So smart agencies share multiple directions—not ten or fifteen but two or three—and let the client pick which one they like the best. Increasing buy-in for whichever route is selected. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=420))

- Rather than thinking about what is wrong with whatever was suggested, they think about which one is better. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=426))
1
- Questions do a couple things. First, like providing a menu, questions shift the listener’s role. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=475))
1
- The same content, though, can be phrased in terms of a question: Do you think junk food is good for you? If a person’s answer to that question is no, they’re now in a tough spot. Because, by asking them to articulate their opinion, the question has encouraged them to put a stake in the ground. To consciously admit that junk food isn’t good for them. And once they’ve done that, it becomes harder to keep eating it. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=486))
1
- Questions encourage listeners to commit to the conclusion. To behave consistently with whatever answer they gave. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=489))
1
- But another route to self-persuasion is to highlight a gap—a disconnect between someone’s thoughts and actions or a disparity between what they might recommend for others versus do themselves. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07THCZ626&location=508))
