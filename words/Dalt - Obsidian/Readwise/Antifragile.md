B - Antifragile

1
- Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=331))

- The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means—crucially—a love of errors, a certain class of errors. Antifragility has a singular property of allowing us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them—and do them well. Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time.

- Black Swan problem—the impossibility of calculating the risks of consequential rare events and predicting their occurrence. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=349))
1
- anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=354))

- At no point in history have so many non-risk-takers, that is, those with no personal exposure, exerted so much control. The chief ethical rule is the following: Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of the fragility of others. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=374))
1
- Black Swans (capitalized) are large-scale unpredictable and irregular events of massive consequence—unpredicted by a certain observer, and such unpredictor is generally called the “turkey” when he is both surprised and harmed by these events. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=378))
1
- The rarer the event, the less tractable, and the less we know about how frequent its occurrence—yet the rarer the event, the more confident these “scientists” involved in predicting, modeling, and using PowerPoint in conferences with equations in multicolor background have become. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=398))

- At the core, he tends to mistake the unknown for the nonexistent. The fragilista falls for the Soviet-Harvard delusion, the (unscientific) overestimation of the reach of scientific knowledge. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=439))

- In short, the fragilista (medical, economic, social planning) is one who makes you engage in policies and actions, all artificial, in which the benefits are small and visible, and the side effects potentially severe and invisible. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=448))

- A complex system, contrary to what people believe, does not require complicated systems and regulations and intricate policies. The simpler, the better. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=460))
1
- Complications lead to multiplicative chains of unanticipated effects. Because of opacity, an intervention leads to unforeseen consequences, followed by apologies about the “unforeseen” aspect of the consequences, then to another intervention to correct the secondary effects, leading to an explosive series of branching “unforeseen” responses, each one worse than the preceding one.

- Less is more and usually more effective. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=466))

- Steve Jobs figured out that “you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.” The Arabs have an expression for trenchant prose: no skill to understand it, mastery to write it. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=470))

- I suddenly realized one day that fragility—which had been lacking a technical definition—could be expressed as what does not like volatility, and that what does not like volatility does not like randomness, uncertainty, disorder, errors, stressors, etc. Think of anything fragile, say, objects in your living room such as the glass frame, the television set, or, even better, the china in the cupboards. If you label them “fragile,” then you necessarily want them to be left alone in peace, quiet, order, and predictability. A fragile object would not possibly benefit from an earthquake or the visit of your hyperactive nephew. Further, everything that does not like volatility does not like stressors, harm, chaos, events, disorder, “unforeseen” consequences, uncertainty, and, critically, time. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=476))

- It likes volatility et al. It also likes time. And there is a powerful and helpful link to nonlinearity: everything nonlinear in response is either fragile or antifragile to a certain source of randomness. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=482))

- First category, academics, report-writers, and commentators who study future events and write books and papers; and, second category, practitioners who, instead of studying future events, try to understand how things react to volatility (but practitioners are usually too busy practitioning to write books, articles, papers, speeches, equations, theories and get honored by Highly Constipated and Honorable Members of Academies). ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=490))

- We keep saying that fragility and antifragility mean potential gain or harm from exposure to something related to volatility. What is that something? Simply, membership in the extended disorder family. The Extended Disorder Family (or Cluster): (i) uncertainty, (ii) variability, (iii) imperfect, incomplete knowledge, (iv) chance, (v) chaos, (vi) volatility, (vii) disorder, (viii) entropy, (ix) time, (x) the unknown, (xi) randomness, (xii) turmoil, (xiii) stressor, (xiv) error, (xv) dispersion of outcomes, (xvi) unknowledge.

- The corpus is called Incerto and is constituted (so far) of a trilogy plus philosophical and technical addenda. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=514))
1
- this one starts from the position that one does not need convincing that (a) Black Swans dominate society and history (and people, because of ex post rationalization, think themselves capable of understanding them); (b) as a consequence, we don’t quite know what’s going on, particularly under severe nonlinearities; so we can get to practical business right away. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=521))

- If the subject is not interesting enough for me to look it up independently, for my own curiosity or purposes, and I have not done so before, then I should not be writing about it at all, period. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=534))

- Just as being nice to the arrogant is no better than being arrogant toward the nice, being accommodating toward anyone committing a nefarious action condones it. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0083DJWGO&location=545))
