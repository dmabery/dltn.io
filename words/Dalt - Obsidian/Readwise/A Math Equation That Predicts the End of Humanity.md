A - A Math Equation That Predicts the End of Humanity

1
- : The Berlin Wall will stand at least 2 and 2/3 more years but no more than 24 more years.
  Demolition on the wall began 21 years later. This motivated Gott to write his method up. He published it in the journal Nature in 1993. There, Gott wrote of the future of humanity itself. He forecast a 95 percent chance that the human race would cease to exist within 12 to 18,000 years. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1561724629/21535402))

- The Copernican principle is normally uncontroversial when applied to an observer’s location in space. Gott’s idea was, why not apply it to a location in time? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1561724629/21535409))

- Gott’s insight was that learning the past duration of the wall gives a clue to its future duration. For a random tourist, that past duration is likely to be a substantial fraction of the wall’s past-and-future existence. This allows an order-of-magnitude estimate of the future duration.
  Suppose you had visited the wall at the 25 percent point in the timeline. At that moment, the wall’s future would have been three times as long as its past (75 percent is three times 25 percent). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1561724629/21535415))

- Criticisms of the doomsday argument are legion. Steven Goodman felt that Gott was misusing the “principle of indifference.” This says that, when you know nothing about which possible outcome will arise, you should assign them equal probabilities.
