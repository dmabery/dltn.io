A - Boredom Is a Pit Stop

- The way to get ideas is to do something boring… They fly into one’s head like birds.

- [Astra Taylor](https://twitter.com/astradisastra), whose essay [*Unschooling*](https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/145471414911) was one of the very first things that got me interested in [unschooling](http://tumblr.austinkleon.com), recently published a piece about [unschooling your kids in the time of Coronavirus](https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/unschooling-your-kids-during-coronavirus-quarantine.html). I love what she wrote about *boredom*:
  > That doesn’t mean unschooling is always easy or that boredom isn’t a challenge, but unschoolers tend to see **boredom as something to be passed through, a pit stop on the way to figuring out what fascinates you**. (“When you’re bored, you’re boring,” my mom would respond whenever we’d whine.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3mapf34ce65p2ca7qzkypcv))

- Agatha Christie, for example, [made an explicit link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/agatha-christie-interview/zmwdvk7) between her occupation, her lack of formal education, and childhood boredom:
  > People often ask me what made me take up writing. Many of them, I fancy, wonder whether to take my answer seriously, although it’s a strictly truthful one. You see, I put it all down to the fact that I never had any education. Perhaps I’d better qualify that — by admitting that I did eventually go to school in Paris when I was 16 or thereabouts. But until then, apart from being taught a little arithmetic, I’d had no lessons to speak of at all. Although I was gloriously idle, in those days children had to do a good many things for themselves. They made their own doll’s furniture, and they made Christmas presents to give to their friends. (Nowadays, they’re just given money and told to buy their presents in a big store.) I found myself making up stories and acting the different parts and **there’s nothing like boredom to make you write.** So by the time I was sixteen or seventeen, I’d written quite a number of short stories and one long dreary novel.

- Neil Gaiman’s advice for writers? “[Get bored](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/11/11/neil-gaimans-advice-to-writers-get-bored/).”
  > [Ideas] come from day dreaming, from drifting, that moment when you’re just sitting there… **The trouble with these days is that it’s really hard to get bored.** I have 2.4 million people on Twitter who will entertain me at any moment…it’s really hard to get bored. I’m much better at putting my phone away, going for boring walks, actually trying to find the space to get bored in. That’s what I’ve started saying to people who say ‘I want to be a writer,” I say ‘great, get bored.‘ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3marcrvrpn3bdky3nrd9e6s))

- We don’t like being bored because boredom is the absence of engaging stimulus, but **boredom is valuable because it requires us to fill that absence out of our own resources, which is process of discovery, of doors opening.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3n39qwyeq9arz9cb59kgdvb))
