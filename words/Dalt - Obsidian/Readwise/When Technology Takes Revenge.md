A - When Technology Takes Revenge

1
- revenge effects.” Tenner coined this term to describe the ways in which technologies can solve one problem while creating additional worse problems, new types of problems, or shifting the harm elsewhere. In short, they bite back.
1
- Thus, when we introduce a new piece of technology, it would be wise to consider whether we are interfering with a wider system.
1
- Although second-order thinking is invaluable, it cannot predict the future with total accuracy. Understanding revenge effects is primarily a reminder of the value of caution and not of specific risks.
1
- Types of revenge effects
1
- Repeating effects: occur when more efficient processes end up forcing us to do the same things more often, meaning they don’t free up more of our time.
1
- Better household appliances have led to higher standards of cleanliness, meaning people end up spending the same amount of time—or more—on housework.
1
- Recomplicating effects: occur when processes become more and more complex as the technology behind them improves. Tenner gives the now-dated example of phone numbers becoming longer with the move away from rotary phones. A modern example might be lighting systems that need to be operated through an app, meaning a visitor cannot simply flip a switch.
1
- Regenerating effects: occur when attempts to solve a problem end up creating additional risks. Targeting pests with pesticides can make them increasingly resistant to harm or kill off their natural predators. Widespread use of antibiotics to control certain conditions has led to be resistant strains of bacteria that are harder to treat.
1
- Rearranging effects: occur when costs are transferred elsewhere so risks shift and worsen. Air conditioning units on subways cool down the trains—while releasing extra heat and making the platforms warmer. Vacuum cleaners can throw dust mite pellets into the air, where they remain suspended and are more easily breathed in. Shielding beaches from waves transfers the water’s force elsewhere.
1
- Revenge effects occur when the technology for solving a problem ends up making it worse due to unintended consequences that are almost impossible to predict in advance.
1
- “Revenge effects happen because new structures, devices, and organisms react with real people in real situations in ways we could not foresee.” He goes on to add that “complexity makes it impossible for anyone to understand how the system might act: tight coupling spreads problems once they begin.”
1
- Revenge effects often involve the transformation of defined, localized risks into nebulous, gradual ones involving the slow accumulation of harm.
1
- Cumulative problems, compared to localized ones, aren’t easy to measure or even necessarily be concerned about.
1
- a revenge effect must actually reverse the benefit for at least a small subset of users.
1
- Likewise, a revenge effect is not just a tradeoff—a benefit we forgo in exchange for some other benefit. As Tenner writes:
  If legally required safety features raise airline fares, that is a tradeoff. But suppose, say, requiring separate seats (with child restraints) for infants, and charging a child’s fare for them, would lead many families to drive rather than fly. More children could in principle die from transportation accidents than if the airlines had continued to permit parents to hold babies on their laps. This outcome would be a revenge effect.
1
- revenge effects are to be expected, even if they cannot be predicted.
1
- “the real benefits usually are not the ones that we expected, and the real perils are not those we feared.”
1
- Before we intervene in a system, assuming it can only improve things, we should be aware that our actions can do the opposite or do nothing at all.
1
- Our estimations of benefits are likely to be more realistic if we are skeptical at first.
1
- If we bring more caution to our attempts to change the world, we are better able to avoid being bitten.
