A - Why Graham Hancock Thinks Everything We Know About Human Prehistory Is Wrong

1
- Ours is not the first advanced, globe-straddling civilisation to have existed on this planet: there was another in the very distant past, now completely lost. 12,800 years ago, he says, this society was destroyed in a natural cataclysm called the Younger Dryas. The planet had been slowly emerging from its Ice Age, but global temperatures suddenly plummeted in a brief period of extreme climate change, and the survivors fanned out across the earth to pass on their secrets to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Usually, this cooling is attributed to natural cycles, but some maintain it was a result of a gigantic extraterrestrial collision. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1556947330/21396143))

- the ram-headed god Khnum, and the Piri Reis map, a 16th-century document he believes encodes secret knowledge from the last Ice Age. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1556947330/21396172))

- There‚Äôs the Phantom Time Hypothesis, which argues that the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries AD simply never happened. Unlike Hancock‚Äôs theory, this one substantially rewrites a very familiar history: there was never a Charlemagne, or an early Middle Ages; the whole thing was concocted by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, and we're actually currently living in the year 1725.

    - Note: üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - what is the phantom time hypothesis and where did it come from? people actually believe this?

- But little can top Anatoly Fomenko‚Äôs New Chronology thesis. A Soviet mathematician, Fomenko believed that he had uncovered numerical patterns hidden in history. A historical text might describe an Egyptian pharaoh who reigned for five years, followed by one who reigned for 17, followed by one who reigned for 30, and another text might describe a sequence of Roman emperors with the exact same pattern. Fomenko decided that these were actually the same people. The ancient kingdom of Israel was the same place as Pharaonic Egypt and the Byzantine Empire: historians had simply taken different accounts of the same events and arranged them sequentially in time. In Fomenko‚Äôs version, Jesus Christ was born in Crimea, and crucified on a hill in Istanbul around the year 1185. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1556947330/21396182))

- Is any of what he says actually true? We know that there have been lost civilisations in history. Five thousand years ago, there was the Harappan civilisation in the Indus Valley, which had indoor plumbing, complex sewage systems, and huge public buildings.

- Eventually all its cities were abandoned, for reasons we can‚Äôt adequately explain. It also had something that looks a lot like writing: plenty of inscriptions survive, but we have no way of translating them. We‚Äôre sitting on hundreds of messages from the very distant past, the words of their gods or the deeds of their kings, never to be understood.

- ‚ÄúBottom line, I don‚Äôt claim I‚Äôm right,‚Äù Graham says. ‚ÄúMy role has been to explore an extraordinary possibility.‚Äù Maybe it‚Äôs useful to keep a few extraordinary ideas around. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1556947330/21396202))
