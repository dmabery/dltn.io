B - Dead Wake

1
- I FIRST STARTED READING about the Lusitania on a whim, following my between-books strategy of reading voraciously and promiscuously. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=246))

- His presence had the perverse effect of affirming everything the passengers had been fearing since their departure from New York, in the way that a priest’s arrival tends to undermine the cheery smile of a nurse. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=284))
1
- Another passenger, a New York businessman named Isaac Lehmann, took a certain comfort from the revolver that he carried with him always and that would, all too soon, bring him a measure of fame, and infamy. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=309))

- She saw a side of Turner that his officers and crew did not. He liked smoking his pipe and telling stories. He loved dogs and cats and had a fascination with bees. He liked to laugh. “On the ships he was a very strict disciplinarian,” Miss Every wrote, “but at Home he was a very kind jolly man and fond of children and animals.” ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=435))

- All preparations for the voyage had to be completed by then, rooms cleaned, beds made, all stores—gin, Scotch, cigars, peas, mutton, beef, ham—loaded aboard, all cargo in place, and the ship’s supply of drinking water tested for freshness and clarity. Special attention was always to be paid to lavatories and bilges, and to maintaining proper levels of ventilation, lest the liner start to stink. The goal, in official Cunard parlance, was “to keep the ship sweet.” ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=507))

- His physician and frequent golf companion, Dr. Cary Grayson, grew concerned. “For several days he has not been well,” Grayson wrote, on August 25, 1914, in a letter to a friend, Edith Bolling Galt. “I persuaded him yesterday to remain in bed during the forenoon. When I went to see him, tears were streaming down his face. It was a heart-breaking scene, a sadder picture no one could imagine. A great man with his heart torn out.” ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=573))

- Helen insisted. “There is not a soul there,” she told Edith. “Cousin Woodrow is playing golf with Dr. Grayson and we will go right upstairs in the elevator and you shall see no one.” They rode to the second floor. As they emerged, they ran headlong into the president and Grayson, both of whom were in their golf clothes. Grayson and Wilson joined the women for tea. Edith wrote later, “This was the accidental meeting which carried out the old adage of ‘turn a corner and meet your fate.’ ” She noted, however, that the golf clothes Wilson had been wearing “were not smart.” ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=828))

- A Bridgeport, Connecticut, man presented his girlfriend with an engagement ring and handed her one end of a ribbon; the other end disappeared into his pocket. “A surprise,” he said, and urged her to pull it. She obliged. The ribbon was attached to the trigger of a revolver. The man died instantly. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=894))

- Room 40. Here resided “the Mystery” or “the Holy of Holies,” its function manifest only to its staff and to a coven of nine senior officials, including First Lord Churchill and Adm. Jacky Fisher, who by April 1915 had reentered the Admiralty as First Sea Lord, Churchill’s number two. Fisher was seventy-four years old, three decades older than his chief. Every day, the watchkeepers in Room 40 received hundreds of coded and enciphered German messages that had been intercepted by an array of wireless stations erected on the British coast, and then sent to the Old Building by land telegraph. Germany had been forced to rely almost exclusively on wireless communication after Britain, in the first days of the war, had followed through on its 1912 plan to cut Germany’s undersea cables. The intercepted messages arrived in the basement of the Admiralty building and were then relayed to Room 40. ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=1436))
1
- To exploit these treasures the Admiralty established Room 40. In a handwritten directive, Churchill set out its primary mission, “to penetrate the German mind,” or, as one of the group’s key officers put it, “to extract the juice.” ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=1454))

- Cunard stockpiled thirty thousand “Three Castles” cigarettes and ten thousand Manila cigars. The ship also sold cigars from Havana and American cigarettes made by Phillip Morris. For the many passengers who brought pipes, Cunard acquired 560 pounds of loose Capstan tobacco—“navy cut”—and 200 pounds of Lord Nelson Flake, both in 4-ounce tins. ([Location 2592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=2592))

- Michael Byrne, a retired New York merchant and former deputy sheriff traveling in first class, apparently planned to spend a good deal of the voyage smoking. He packed 11 pounds of Old Rover Tobacco and three hundred cigars. ([Location 2595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=2595))

    - Note: How legal
1
- Churchill wrote that it was “most important to attract neutral shipping to our shores, in the hopes especially of embroiling the United States with Germany.” Though no one said it explicitly, Britain hoped the United States would at some point feel moved to join the Allies, and in so doing tip the balance irrevocably in their favor. After noting that Germany’s submarine campaign had sharply reduced traffic from America, Churchill told Runciman: “For our part, we want the traffic—the more the better; and if some of it gets into trouble, better still.” ([Location 3040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=3040))

- As the torpedo advanced, the water rushing past its nose turned a small propeller, which unscrewed a safety device that prevented detonation during storage. This propeller slipped from the nose and fell to the sea bottom, thereby exposing a triggering mechanism that upon impact with a ship’s hull would fire a small charge into the larger body of explosives. A gyroscope kept the torpedo on course, adjusting for vertical and horizontal deflection. ([Location 3751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=3751))

1
- Men at the bow and stern manipulated the ropes—the falls—that ran through block and tackle at each end of the boat. A sailor at the bow lost control of his rope. Ogden tried to grab it, but the rope was running so fast it tore the skin from his hands. The bow plunged; the stern rope held. Everyone fell from the boat into the sea, 60 feet below. Ogden came to the surface; his wife did not. He reached for an oar floating nearby. ([Location 4002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4002))

- Bretherton had no idea where her baby was. On the way to the lifeboat, she had seen the man to whom she had given the child, but the man’s arms were empty. ([Location 4113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4113))

- The final angle of list, by Morton’s estimate, was 30 degrees. Sixty passengers made it. Asked later how this feat had been achieved, Morton answered, “If you had to jump six or seven feet, or certainly drown, it is surprising what ‘a hell of a long way’ even older people can jump.” ([Location 4190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4190))
1
- This was curious logic, for the “urgent necessity” was if anything far greater, with hundreds of passengers and crew now adrift in 55-degree waters. It testified to the importance the Admiralty placed on protecting its big warships and heeding the hard lesson taught by the Aboukir disaster, to never go to the aid of submarine victims. ([Location 4316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4316))
1
- As they approached the vessel, Margaret Gwyer, still coated in soot, saw her husband standing at its rail and called to him. His expression, Lauriat wrote, was “perfectly blank.” He had no idea who this blackened young woman could be. He recognized her only when the collapsible came right under the smack’s rail, and he was able to look directly into her face. He wept. ([Location 4471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4471))

- His telegram, relayed to the Admiralty’s War Room in London, read, “We proceeded with all possible speed 3:45 p.m. sighted submarine about 200 yards on our starboard quarter, submarine fired torpedo which passed ten yards astern of us, maneuvered ship and got all clear; submarine was seen astern 10 minutes later 4 P.M.… Saw no sign of Lusitania believe call to be a hoax.” Captain Harwood changed heading and fled away from the last reported location of the Lusitania.

- Turner’s own lawyer, Butler Aspinall, Britain’s leading expert in maritime law, did his best to sculpt Turner’s story into a coherent account of the Lusitania’s last morning and to win for him Lord Mersey’s sympathy. “I mean to say, we have the very great advantage of knowing so much now which was unknown to him then,” Aspinall said; “we are sitting upon the matter in cool judgment, with an opportunity of looking at the charts, and the circumstances under which we are dealing with it were not the circumstances under which the Master would have an opportunity of dealing with it.” ([Location 4914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4914))

- Patrick Beesly, who, during World War II, was himself an officer in British naval intelligence. Britain’s secrecy laws prevented him from writing about the subject until the 1970s and 1980s, when he published several books, including one about Room 40, said to be a quasi-official account. ([Location 4943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4943))
1
- “As an Englishman and a lover of the Royal Navy,” he said, “I would prefer to attribute this failure to negligence, even gross negligence, rather [than] to a conspiracy deliberately to endanger the ship.” But, he said, “on the basis of the considerable volume of information which is now available, I am reluctantly compelled to state that on balance, the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war.” So much was done for the Orion and other warships, he wrote, but nothing for the Lusitania. He struggled with this. No matter how he arranged the evidence, he came back to conspiracy. He said, “If that’s unacceptable, will someone tell me another explanation to these very very curious circumstances?” ([Location 4947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4947))
1
- What most likely caused the second event was the rupture of a main steam line, carrying steam under extreme pressure. This was Turner’s theory from the beginning. The fracture could have been caused by the direct force of the initial explosion, or by cold seawater entering Boiler Room No. 1 and coming into contact with the superheated pipe or its surrounding fixtures, causing a potentially explosive condition known as thermal shock. ([Location 4982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4982))

    - Note: Lopk up thedmal shock
1
- Had Captain Turner not had to wait the extra two hours for the transfer of passengers from the Cameronia, he likely would have passed Schwieger in the fog, when U-20 was submerged and on its way home. For that matter, even the brief delay caused by the last-minute disembarkation of Turner’s niece could have placed the ship in harm’s way. More importantly, had Turner not been compelled to shut down the fourth boiler room to save money, he could have sped across the Atlantic at 25 knots, covering an additional 110 miles a day, and been safely to Liverpool before Schwieger even entered the Celtic Sea. ([Location 4989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=4989))

- Wilson’s protest—the so-called First Lusitania Note—was the initial salvo in what would become a two-year war of paper, filled with U.S. protests and German replies, made against a backdrop of new attacks against neutral ships and revelations that German spies were at work in America. ([Location 5064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=5064))
1
- WILSON WON reelection in 1916. He played golf nearly every day, often with the new Mrs. Wilson. They even played in snow: Secret Service man Starling painted the golf balls red to improve visibility. They routinely took drives through the countryside, a pastime Wilson adored. Marriage buoyed his spirits and eased his loneliness. ([Location 5097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=5097))
1
- Outside the White House, Wilson’s many notes to Germany and their replies became the target of wry humor, as when one editor wrote: “Dear Kaiser: In spite of previous correspondence on the subject another ship with American citizens on board has been sunk. Under the circumstances we feel constrained to inform you, in a spirit of utmost friendliness, that a repetition of the incident will of necessity require the dispatch of another note to your majesty’s most estimable and peace-loving government.” ([Location 5101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=5101))

- As historian Barbara Tuchman put it: “All these papers had been ardently neutral until Zimmermann shot an arrow in the air and brought down neutrality like a dead duck.” ([Location 5195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=5195))

- To Winston Churchill, it was long overdue. In his memoir-like history The World Crisis, 1916–1918, he said of Wilson, “What he did in April, 1917, could have been done in May, 1915. And if done then what abridgment of the slaughter; what sparing of the agony; what ruin, what catastrophes would have been prevented; in how many million homes would an empty chair be occupied today; how different would be the shattered world in which victors and vanquished alike are condemned to live!” ([Location 5240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=5240))

- These were the descendants of the colonials returning now at Britain’s hour of need, the moment captured in an immediately famous painting by Bernard Gribble, The Return of the Mayflower. ([Location 5257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=5257))
1
- The side-to-side roll became more pronounced with each cycle, to the point where the ship looked as if it were being buffeted by a heavy sea. This, the pilot explained, was called a “horse storm,” and under certain conditions it could bang a ship against its wharf and damage deck rails and boats. ([Location 5277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PD3GE&location=5277))

- A new war came, and on September 16, 1941, a Nazi U-boat torpedoed and sank a British ship, the Jedmoor, off the Outer Hebrides, killing thirty-one of its thirty-six crew. Among the lost was a fifty-five-year-old able seaman named Percy Wilfred Turner—Captain Turner’s youngest son.
