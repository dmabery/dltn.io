T - It's 2021, and Coffee Is...

1
- It's 2021, and coffee is a luxury. We're obsessed with it, and we'll anything for it.
  We're in coffee's 5th wave (@fromedome and @web recently wrote about coffee's importance culturally).
  Here's a thread about coffee's history, how we got here, and what's ahead.
  Buckle up üëá üßµ

- We're living in the golden age of coffee. We can buy it anywhere we want, anyway we want. 
  But it wasn't always like that.
  Coffee has endured a lot and has changed so much over decades, much less the last 15 years! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809718982606848))
1
- We're gonna explore coffee in five waves, and how the fifth one is a manifestation of all of them. 
  Here they are:
  1. Coffee is a commodity
  2. Coffee is community
  3. Coffee has a story
  4. Coffee is scientific
  5. Coffee is a luxury
  Let's dive in! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809720194736130))
1
- 1. Coffee is a commodity
  In this wave, coffee was functional. It was always about mass distribution. You bought your coffee in bulk, brewed it in large coffee pots, and cared less about flavor notes or quality.
  There was no curated experience around coffee.

1
- 2. Coffee is community
  In this wave, coffee went from being "functional" to represent an experience. It was the first wave where you could ‚Äúbrand‚Äù coffee and persuade consumers to buy into an experience. 
  This is where brands like Starbucks, Barney‚Äôs, and Peet‚Äôs Coffee emerged.

1
- 3. Coffee has a story
  The third¬†wave has (in my view) influenced millennials' understanding of coffee the most. Coffee went from being a communal, "internet caf√©" vibe to focusing on coffee as a story. 
  This is the wave of brands like Blue Bottle, Intelligentsia, and Stumptown.

1
- One more note: in this era, brands concerned themselves with with being viewed as transparent and ethical. 
  Shops would share how they grow their coffee, where they get it from, sharing photos of farmers in developing countries, etc. 
  Being ‚ÄúFair Trade‚Äù was a label you wanted.

1
- 4. Coffee is scientific
  The first wave was dedicated to perfecting coffee.
  Brewing your pour-over at just the right water temperature, with the exact amount of beans, understanding the chemistry of coffee, became paramount for shop owners, baristas, and consumers.

1
- Drip coffee went backburner; baristas pushed single-origin coffees with unique beans from remote areas.
  Barista Parlor (Nashville) and Houndstooth (Texas) were born out of this wave, + shops also took on a more clean, minimalist aesthetic. White walls, plants, natural light.

- 5. Coffee is a luxury
  A blend of all five waves.
  International, yet local. Simple, and complex. Exclusive, but also accessible. Expensive, and something we‚Äôll happily pay for.
  AND, it's the first wave to really leverage eCommerce as a way to connect with customers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809776884981760))
1
- Here's how the 5th wave is defining the way Americans consume coffee. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809778134880256))
1
- Subscriptions, eCommerce, and dropshipping
  Today we can literally buy whatever we want, when we want it, and how we want it. @tradecoffeeco is owning this space, as they've managed to make high-end coffee accessible to anyone from around the US.
  How? Dropshipping.

1
- Trade owns no inventory.
  When you place an order, the order gets pushed over to that roaster and they fulfill it with Trade‚Äôs packaging, similar to how you‚Äôd buy something on Amazon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809786523414530))
1
- Then there's @yonder_coffee, a high-end coffee subscription. Where Trade focuses on US roasters, Yonder curates roasters overseas, ones you‚Äôd otherwise not have access to.
  For $35 you can get 1 coffee bag roasted in Germany or South Korea and it's delivered to you in a week. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809787840548867))
1
- The fact that Yonder can even charge that number for a single product only illustrates that we're in the luxury era of coffee.
  We'll pay whatever it takes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809789883052036))
1
- Ah, instant (frozen) coffee
  While Keurig and Nespresso have had their moment normalizing instant coffee for the masses, they‚Äôre often criticized for their low-grade quality if you‚Äôre drinking it black.
  There‚Äôs a solution to that problem: @cometeer. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9Qm7_zUUAE9_P5.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809798829576193))
1
- Cometeer pre-grinds and brews the coffee for you, flash-freezing (via liquid nitrogen -321 degrees) it at peak flavor. 
  All you have to do is melt it with hot water when you‚Äôre ready to drink it, and voila.
  Instant coffee. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809800339525633))
1
- Capitalizing on coffee
  It's fun seeing how coffee brands are commercializing an experience.
  Blue Bottle has 60+ locations and a steady online business. 
  Stumptown and Intelligentsia have both had 9-figure exits to JAB Holdings.
  Coffee is big business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809801564258310))
1
- Ultimately, I believe the brands that will win long-term are focused on delivering curated experiences regardless of where you discover their product.
  This happened to me last month, I was recently at the Nashville airport and wanted coffee before my flight, so... üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809802759606273))
1
- I waited in line at an old, dingy Starbucks for 30 minutes, just for drip coffee. It was all there was (so I thought). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/claytonchambrs/status/1428809803992748038))
1
- I finally got it and walked to my gate. Next to that gate was a Barista Parlor, bright, sleek, and modern.
  My heart sank. I would've happily paid $6.50 for a pour-over instead.
  Coffee is a luxury.
