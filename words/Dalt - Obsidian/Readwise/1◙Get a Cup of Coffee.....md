  Get a cup of coffee.
  In this thread, I'll walk you through the basics of leverage -- in our personal lives and in the companies we invest in. https://t.co/9MilmwE9f7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942728222011395))

  Imagine we have an idea for a business.
  To start the business, we need to put in $1M.
  In return, the business will generate $250K for us every year -- for 10 years.
  So, our upfront investment is $1M. But over the next 10 years, we get to take out $250K * 10 = $2.5M. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942730411438082))

  This is an "unleveraged" annual return (IRR) of about 21.4%.
  "Unleveraged" means we don't borrow any money.
  That is, we use our own money for the initial $1M investment.

  What if we instead borrow part of the $1M?
  This would be a "leveraged" scenario.
  For example, let's say we use 4:1 leverage.
  That means: to get the initial $1M, we put in $200K of our own money, and borrow the remaining $800K.
  $800K : $200K = 4:1. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942737470451714))

  Of course, when we borrow money, we have to pay interest.
  Suppose our interest rate is 5% per year.
  That means: we pay 5% of our $800K loan = $40K in interest each year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942738900783107))

  Plus, at the end of 10 years, we have to return the principal ($800K).
  To do this, let's say we set aside $80K per year -- in each of the next 10 years.
  At the end of 10 years, that will leave us with $80K * 10 = exactly the $800K we'll need to pay back the loan. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942740238692352))

  So, of the $250K our business will generate for us each year, $40K goes towards interest and $80K is set aside to pay back the principal.
  This leaves us with $250K - ($40K + $80K) = $130K in cash that we can take out of the business each year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942741522186240))

  So, *with* leverage, our cash flows look like this:
  We put in $200K upfront.
  We take out $130K per year -- over the next 10 years.
  That's a *leveraged* IRR of about 64.6% (annualized). https://t.co/rYUUHaumpL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942745754198019))

  So:
  Unleveraged IRR = ~21.4% per year.
  Leveraged IRR = ~64.6% per year.
  That's the power of leverage.
  In physics, leverage lets us move a heavy object using a small force.
  In investing, leverage allows us to get a high return using a small amount of capital. https://t.co/BZm6FamHgr ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942781074432004))

  But unfortunately, that's not the whole story.
  The problem is: Leverage comes with risk.
  This risk decreases our margin of safety. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942783414865924))

  For example, what happens if our business performs below our expectations?
  That is, what if our $250K per year projection turns out to be overly optimistic?
  How much of a hit can we take to that $250K before we start losing money? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942784790552576))
1
- 12/
  In the *unleveraged* case, we put in $1M of our own money.
  So, as long as the business makes at least $100K per year (over 10 years), we won't lose money. We'll be "in the black".
  That is, our "margin of safety" is $250K - $100K = $150K per year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942786212458499))
1
- 13/
  What about the *leveraged* case?
  Here, we need $120K per year just to "service" the loan ($40K for interest, $80K for principal).
  Plus, we need an extra $20K per year to break-even on the $200K of our own money that we put in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942787604975616))
1
- 14/
  So, for us to be "in the black", the business will need to generate at least $120K + $20K = $140K per year.
  That means: our "margin of safety" is only $250K - $140K = $110K per year.
  So, leverage has reduced our margin of safety by ~27% -- from $150K to $110K per year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942789022638082))

  This is the crucial thing to understand when it comes to leverage:
  Leverage can amplify returns.
  But it also amplifies risk.
  As leverage increases, our tolerance for error -- our "margin of safety" -- decreases; it doesn't take much to push us from black to red. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942790360621058))

  For example, this plot shows our IRR vs our business's cash flows -- at various leverage levels (1:1, 2:1, etc.).
  With no leverage (the blue line), our IRR drops gracefully as cash flows decrease.
  But as leverage increases, our IRRs drop off much more sharply. https://t.co/Ow3QGSkg6H ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942794286530560))

  Of course, businesses employ various kinds of leverage -- some more dangerous than others.
  For example, some businesses use short term liabilities that they constantly "roll over".
  This can include negative working capital, insurance float, deferred taxes, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942796236845059))
1
- 18/
  Usually, this leverage is benign.
  But for that:
  a) the liability shouldn't suddenly shrink by a lot (eg, insurance policies that run off but don't renew), and
  b) the business shouldn't rely on credit markets (ie, the kindness of strangers) to roll over short term debt. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942797579034630))
1
- 19/
  Long term debt (eg, via corporate bonds) is another form of leverage.
  This is somewhat more risky -- as periodic interest and principal payments are usually required.
  But as long as such obligations are fixed and known ahead of time, they can be planned for. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942799021821956))
1

  The most dangerous form of leverage is one that could require the business to post a lot of cash at short notice.
  For example, a bank run.
  Or a naked derivatives contract that blows up.
  Or a disaster that triggers claims from a large number of insurance policies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942800418566146))

  Time and again, Buffett's letters warn us of the dangers of such kinds of leverage: https://t.co/0Xp3hESAv8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942806420574208))

  When we invest in companies that employ significant amounts of leverage, it's crucial to understand our margin of safety -- how bad can things become before the result is permanent loss of capital? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942809012731904))

  Ideally, the business's cash flows (even in bad years) should more than cover any interest/principal payments.
  Also, the business should have sufficient balance sheet strength (ie, assets that can be readily converted to cash) to meet all near-term obligations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942810287726593))

  Similar logic also applies to managing leverage in our *personal* finances.
  Here are a few tips for that.
  Tip 1. We should never trade on margin. It's a Russian roulette type situation.
  Most of the time, securities bought on margin may not go down drastically. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942811617320970))
1
- 25/
  But from time to time, they will.
  This can trigger a "margin call" that can obliterate us.
  In effect, this transforms "short term volatility" into "long term risk".
  So, it's best to avoid trading on margin, naked options strategies, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380942812942716928))

  Tip 2. As far as possible, we should avoid taking out a loan to buy a *depreciating* asset.
  This includes automobiles, and most things bought with credit cards.
  So, a corollary is to pay off credit cards in full each month. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380943118107746310))
1
- 27/
  Tip 3: When taking out a loan to buy an *appreciating* asset (eg, a mortgage to buy a house), we should follow 3 simple rules.
  Rule 1. We should clearly understand our obligations (eg, fixed vs variable interest rates, monthly payments, additional insurance needed, etc.). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380943119944806401))
1
- 28/
  Rule 2. Our *current* earning power and assets on hand should be more than adequate to meet our obligations (both interest and principal).
  Rule 3. Margin of safety. We should be able to take a reasonable hit to our earnings/assets and still meet our obligations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1380943121555419136))

  If you're still with me, thank you very much!
  Leverage is a fairly basic topic.
  But it's the No. 1 culprit behind most financial disasters.
  I hope this thread showed you both the benefits and the pitfalls of leverage.
  Please stay safe. Enjoy your weekend!
