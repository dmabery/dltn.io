A - Amp It Up! | LinkedIn

1
- Bottom line: There is room up in organizations to boost performance by amping up the pace and intensity. Considerable slack naturally exists in organizations to perform at much higher levels. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325589))
1
- The role of a leader is to change the status quo, step up the pace, and increase the intensity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325597))
1
- Some people drain energy from organizations; not leaders, they engulf organizations with energy. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325598))
1
- Our companies were built and run for performance, full stop. We were singleminded in our pursuit of goals, and drove our people to become the best version of themselves. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325607))
1
- Few things drive home a performance culture like the compensation philosophy. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325611))
1
- We insisted on a bell shaped distribution. We did not always pay full bonuses and I would personally explain why in our quarterly all hands meetings. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325613))
1
- Each employee had a money conversation each quarter with their manager relating to performance. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325618))
1
- Passengers end up in the same place as drivers but they are dead weight. If that was a subtle distinction, there would be work to do. Ask yourself at the end of a work week: did it really, really matter that I was there? At the end of the month? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325626))
1
- I will outline three vectors that together make up a performance execution framework. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325629))
1
- oing faster, maintaining higher standards and with a narrower aperture. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325675))
1
- How much faster do you run? How much higher are your standards? How hard do you focus? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325678))
1
- As a leader, your opportunity is to reset in each of these dimensions. You do it in every single conversation, meeting, and encounter. You look for and exploit every single opportunity to step up the pace, expect a higher quality outcome, and narrow the plane of attack. Then, you relentlessly follow up and prosecute at every turn. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325688))
1
- Culture sorts like-minded people from the rest of the pack. You will find out who your keepers are, and some who are not. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325703))
1
- Increasing velocity ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325709))
1
- Same thing applies in interactions with other stakeholders, especially customers who all have expectations about reasonable response times. It is easy to differentiate yourself by changing cycle times because few bother to do it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325725))
1
- ServiceNow had a relentless ‘get shit done’ culture and they were proud of it. The culture enthusiastically embraced those who got things done, and it repelled those who did not. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325732))
1
- But with pressure applied, somebody all of a sudden figures out how to do things differently, and get things dramatically sooner. Pressure changes things. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325791))
1
- Quickening the pace also drives a narrower focus. You simply can't move very fast when you are pushing on too many fronts at the same time. More about this further down. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325798))
1
- I enjoyed quoting the late Steve Jobs who had just two classifications: it’s either ‘insanely great’, or it’s ‘total shit’. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325808))
1
- So, let’s resolve to love what we produce, not just like it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325812))
1
- B players need to be pared: they either become A players, or they become C players and get flushed out. You can help by raising standards, by refusing mediocre outcomes. Channel your inner Steve Jobs. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325817))
1
- The fastest way to move a dial is narrow the focus. People naturally resist focus because they can’t decide what is important. Therein lies a problem: people can typically tell you after some deliberation what their top three priorities are, but they struggle to decide on just one. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325825))
1
- When you narrow focus, you are increasing the resourcing on the remaining priority. It doesn’t have to time-slice and compete any more with a bunch of other stuff. And then things begin to move, stuff is getting done, and we move to the next thing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325830))
1
- Pointed, critical thinking is rare. I have been in board meetings where CEOs would declare as many as ten priorities. Reminds us of Mark Twain who wrote us a long letter because he had no time for a short one. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325834))
1
- I only did things and applied resources that had a compelling line-of-sight relationship with that goal. In tech, value is a function of growth, so we ran our companies for growth, period. It was an easy call when spending proposals came forward that had no discernible relationship with the mission. Investors were obviously in violent agreement. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325850))
1
- We compensated the ServiceNow exec team on just one metric. It was unquestionably the purest performance metric for a cloud software company. Our board fought me on this. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325869))
1
- They were convinced a grown up company had to have a balanced scorecard, arguably the worst idea to ever come out of academia. People say they want focus, but their actions do not bear it out, quite the opposite. Focus is hard once you understand what that means. What are you not going to do? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325872))
1
- Either you are completely focused on and aligned with your goals, or you let in all kinds of noise that dilutes your limited resources. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325877))
1
- You lack focus at the top, it will be much more so at the bottom. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325881))
1
- I am not the leader of the free world, just a CEO working to increase the value of the franchise entrusted to him. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14325887))
1
- Leaders set standards of performance for others to follow. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344431886/14329872))
