A - Betteridge's law of headlines

1
- **Betteridge's law of headlines** is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word *no*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmyp6g4zks2ts1a69hkkzw22))

- It is based on the assumption that if the publishers were confident that the answer was *yes*, they would have presented it as an assertion; by presenting it as a question, they are not accountable for whether it is correct or not. The adage does not apply to questions that are more [open-ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question#wh) than strict [yes–no questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes%E2%80%93no_question).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMurtha2015-3) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmyp72cmegdy3wmkm21gt1xe))

- similar observation was made by British newspaper editor [Andrew Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Marr) in his 2004 book *My Trade*, among Marr's suggestions for how a reader should interpret newspaper articles:
  > If the headline asks a question, try answering 'no'. Is This the True Face of Britain's Young? (Sensible reader: No.) Have We Found the Cure for [AIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS)? (No; or you wouldn't have put the question mark in.) Does This Map Provide the Key for Peace? (Probably not.) A headline with a question mark at the end means, in the vast majority of cases, that the story is tendentious or over-sold. It is often a scare story, or an attempt to elevate some run-of-the-mill piece of reporting into a national controversy and, preferably, a national panic. To a busy journalist hunting for real information a question mark means 'don't bother reading this bit'.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarr2004253-11) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmyp98j3g3sjepj7vhpak8td))

- Question headlines are not legally sound when it comes to avoiding defamation.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines#cite_note-FOOTNOTESack19992–48-23) The [Supreme Court of Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Oklahoma) held in 1913, in its decision in *Spencer v. Minnick*, that "A man cannot libel another by the publication of language the meaning and damaging effect of which is clear to all men, and where the identity of the person meant cannot be doubted, and then escape liability through the use of a question mark."

- A 2013 study into [computer-mediated communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-mediated_communication) came to a similar conclusion, finding that question headlines posted to [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) and [eBay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay) increased click-through rates in comparison to statement headlines and that questions that address or reference the reader have statistically significant higher click-through rates than rhetorical or general questions.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJarrett2013-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines#cite_note-FOOTNOTELaiFarbrot2013-36) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmypewyz8bfz39eenyy7h44q))

- Hinchliffe's rule
  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept is known as **Hinchliffe's rule**, after physicist [Ian Hinchliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hinchliffe), who stated that if a research paper's title is in the form of a yes–no question, the answer to that question will be "no" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmypf8ywbyzt0qcpbsptybw8))
