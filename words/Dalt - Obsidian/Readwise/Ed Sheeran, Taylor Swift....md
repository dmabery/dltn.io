T - Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift...

1
- Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, and Drake generate non-stop hits for years.
  What are they doing differently?

1
- I was watching a documentary on songwriter Ed Sheeran. In it, he described his songwriting process. 
  It struck me as identical to the process that author Neil Gaiman detailed in his Masterclass. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356374751776768))
1
- Here's the thing.
  Ed Sheeran and Neil Gaiman are in the top 0.000001% of their fields. They're among very few people in the world who consistently generate blockbuster after blockbuster. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356375913598976))

- If two world-class creators share the exact same creative process, I get curious.
  I call their approach the Creativity Faucet: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356377557688320))
1
- Visualize your creativity as a backed-up pipe of water. The first mile of piping is packed with wastewater. 
  This wastewater must be emptied before the clear water arrives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356378690150402))
1
- Because your pipe only has one faucet, there's no shortcut to achieving clarity other than first emptying the wastewater. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356379952697345))

- Let's apply this to creativity: 
  At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that reflexively comes to mind. 
  Instead of being self-critical and resisting these bad ideas, accept them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356381059936258))
1
- Once the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.
  Here's my guess as to why: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356382255390722))
1
- Once you've generated enough bad output, your mind begins to reflexively identify which elements caused the badness. 
  Then it begins to avoid them. You start pattern-matching novel ideas with greater intuition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356383366860800))
1
- Most creators never get past their wastewater. They resist their bad ideas.
  If you've opened a blank document, scribbled a few thoughts, then walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you too didn't get past it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356384570626049))
1
- Neil and Ed know they're not superhuman. 
  They simply treat the brain as a pipeline for entering a creative flow state, and they never forget that the pipe needs clearing.
  In every creative session, they allot time for emptying the wastewater. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356385791188993))
1
- They're not worrying whether clear water will eventually arrive. It always does:
  • Your work starts as a weak imitation.
  • You identify what makes the imitation weak.
  • You iterate on the imitation until it's original. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356387003334657))
1
- Mozart had 600 musical compositions and Edison had 1093 patents. 
  Only a few are remembered today, and that's the point. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1402356388320276480))
