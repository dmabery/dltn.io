T - Bitcoin Is Down ~25% Ove...

1
- Bitcoin is down ~25% over the past 10 days.
  But it has still outperformed gold by 66x and the S&P 500 by 11x over the last decade.
  IMHO - Bitcoin is the worldâ€™s best savings technology. 
  Here's a thread on how to keep more of it. ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945192155074565))

- 2/ First, look at what investors call CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate). It's a way to break down growth across assets, on the same time frame, and compare them.
  Over the past decade, Bitcoin's is 132%.
  Gold's is 2%. The S&P 500's is 12% (h/t @Case4Bitcoin)

- 3/ A 132% CAGR means that your money has more than doubled every year over the past decade ðŸ¤¯ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945198136139777))

- 4/ However, growth isn't that smooth in real life. Bitcoin is still a relatively new asset (created just 12 years ago) and there will be volatility.
  But if you believe in the long-term future of bitcoin, there is no need to panic when there are dips. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945204242956292))

- 5/ And if you're a hodler who believes in the long-term future of bitcoin, the best way to do it is within an IRA with @choicebykt
  Why? So you don't pay capital gains taxes on your trades, while you are still investing.

- 6/ There are two main types of IRAs -- Traditional IRAs & Roth IRAs.
  The maximum annual contribution for most people is $6,000 for both (depending on your age and income, everyone's tax situation is unique - DYOR). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945209263640580))

- 7/ If you open a Traditional IRA, when you withdraw the money after you turn 59Â½ it is considered income, so you have to pay income taxes on it. 
  However, you can deduct your contributions from your taxable income lowering your tax bill in the process. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945211029442566))
1
- 8/ If you use a Roth IRA you don't have to pay ANY taxes on your gains, even after you withdraw your money. 
  Because you pay income taxes on the dollars before contributing, you can withdraw the money tax-free after the age of 59Â½.
  Tax. Efficient. Bitcoin. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945212858146822))

- 9/ Legacy retirement accounts limit your choices and encourage you to put your money in a target-date fund.
  @choicebykt enables you to plan for your future how you see fit. 
  You can own bitcoin, other digital assets, alternative assets, & traditional assets all in one account. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945214498037761))
1
- 10/ It's no coincidence that retirement accounts with crypto in them are more than 2x the national average.
  National average for retirement accounts = ~$105K; 0% crypto allocation
  @choicebykt average = ~$215K; 67% crypto allocation
  Not advice, just facts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945216184143872))
1
- 11/ To summarize:
  1) There will be volatility. Invest for the long term.
  2) #bitcoin is the world's best savings technology.
  3) @choicebykt is the best (and tax-efficient) way to save. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1396945217656328192))

- Oh, and @choicebykt also lets you hold your private keys.
  That is why I am not only a user of the product for my own IRA, but Choice became a podcast sponsor a few months ago to spread the word about this great wealth hack.
