A - Exploring Theme: A Key Component to Successful Writing

1
- A well-told story, the kind that gets published or made into a film, usually doesn’t elicit such a response. As an intelligent reader or viewer you intuitively know what it was *about*, and usually on two levels: it was about the plot…and, in a different experiential context, it was about what the story *means*.
  The latter is called *theme*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h52e1dtst8tsdjvyx7zcy3bj))

- But *The Da Vinci Code* was about so much more than its plot. It was about the veracity of the dominant religion of Western culture. It was about a speculated truth that had been, according to the story, swept under the rug of time. It was about the lengths people will go to in the name of what they believe.
  On a *thematic* level, *this* was what the story was all about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h52e2qce630sv443ht0rat66))

- To put it in its most simple terms, theme is what our story *means*. How it *relates* to reality and life in general. What is says about life and the infinite roster of issues, facets, challenges and experiences it presents.

- Theme is the *relevance* of your story to life. To reality, as reflected in your fiction. Theme is love and hate, the folly of youth, the treachery of commerce, the minefield of marriage, the veracity of religion, heaven and hell, past and future, science versus nature, betrayal, friendship, loyalty, Machiavellian agenda, wealth and poverty, mercy and courage and wisdom and greed and lust and laughter.
  Theme is life itself, as manifested in our stories, as seen through our characters, and as experienced through our plots. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h52e4y3xzhkxx8w1rsp1mjcf))
