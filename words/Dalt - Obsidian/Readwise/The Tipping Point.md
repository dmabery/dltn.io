B - The Tipping Point

1
- These three characteristics—one, contagiousness; two, the fact that little causes can have big effects; and three, that change happens not gradually but at one dramatic moment —are the same three principles that define how measles moves through a grade-school classroom or the flu attacks every winter. Of the three, the third trait—the idea that epidemics can rise or fall in one dramatic moment—is the most important, because it is the principle that makes sense of the first two and that permits the greatest insight into why modern change happens the way it does.

- The Tipping Point is the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=143))

- who transmit infectious agents, the infectious agent itself, and the environment in which the infectious agent is operating. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=218))

- The Stickiness Factor says that there are specific ways of making a contagious message memorable; there are relatively simple changes in the presentation and structuring of information that can make a big difference in how much of an impact it makes. 3.

- When people are in a group, in other words, responsibility for acting is diffused. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=338))

- The Power of Context says that human beings are a lot more sensitive to their environment than they may seem. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=344))

- The three rules of the Tipping Point—the Law of the Few, the Stickiness Factor, the Power of Context—offer ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=346))

- When two people talk, they don’t just fall into physical and aural harmony. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1000))

- Sesame Street succeeded because it learned how to make television sticky. ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1088))
1
- The Law of the Few, which I talked about in the previous chapter, says that one critical factor in epidemics is the nature of the messenger. ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1089))
1
- In epidemics, the messenger matters: messengers are what make something spread. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1097))
1
- the addition of the map and the times when the shots were available shifted the booklet from an abstract lesson in medical risk—a lesson no different from the countless other academic lessons they had received over their academic career—to a practical and personal piece of medical advice. ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1168))
1
- This was the legacy of Sesame Street: If you paid careful attention to the structure and format of your material, you could dramatically enhance stickiness. ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1319))

- If they don’t catch something in a narrative structure, it doesn’t get remembered very well, and it doesn’t seem to be accessible for further kinds of mulling over.” ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1427))

- preschooler, they are surrounded by stuff they don’t understand—things that are novel. So the driving force for a preschooler is not a search for novelty, like it is with older kids, it’s a search for understanding and predictability,” ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1523))

- We all want to believe that the key to making an impact on someone lies with the inherent quality of the ideas we present. But in none of these cases did anyone substantially alter the content of what they were saying. Instead, they tipped the message by tinkering, on the margin, with the presentation of their ideas, by putting the Muppet behind the H-U-G, by mixing Big Bird with the adults, by repeating episodes and skits more than once, by having Steve pause just a second longer than normal after he asks a question, by putting a tiny gold box in the corner of the ad.

- Howard Levanthal didn’t redouble his efforts to terrify his students into getting a tetanus shot. He just threw in a map and a set of appointment times. ([Location 1600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1600))

- The Law of the Few says that there are exceptional people out there who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them. The lesson of stickiness is the same. There is a simple way to package information that, under the right circumstances, can make it irresistible. All you have to do is find it. ([Location 1601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1601))
1
- The Law of the Few looked at the kinds of people who are critical in spreading information. The chapter on Sesame Street and Blue’s Clues looked at the question of Stickiness, suggesting that in order to be capable of sparking epidemics, ideas have to be memorable and move us to action.

- Broken Windows was the brainchild of the criminologists James Q. Wilson and George Kelling. Wilson and Kelling argued that crime is the inevitable result of disorder. If a window is broken and left unrepaired, people walking by will conclude that no one cares and no one is in charge. Soon, more windows will be broken, and the sense of anarchy will spread from the building to the street on which it faces, sending a signal that anything goes.

- epidemic can be reversed, can be tipped, by tinkering with the smallest details of the immediate environment. ([Location 1770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1770))

- But what Zimbardo and Hartshorne and May are suggesting is that this is a mistake, that when we think only in terms of inherent traits and forget the role of situations, we’re deceiving ourselves about the real causes of human behavior. ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1916))
1
- The mistake we make in thinking of character as something unified and all-encompassing is very similar to a kind of blind spot in the way we process information. Psychologists call this tendency the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE), which is a fancy way of saying that when it comes to interpreting other people’s behavior, human beings invariably make the mistake of overestimating the importance of fundamental character traits and underestimating the importance of the situation and context. ([Location 1936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=1936))

- actual contents of your thoughts are less important, in the end, in guiding your actions than the immediate context of your behavior. ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=2004))
1
- But we need to remember that small changes in context can be just as important in tipping epidemics, even though that fact appears to violate some of our most deeply held assumptions about human nature. ([Location 2011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=2011))

- that small, close-knit groups have the power to magnify the epidemic potential of a message or idea. ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OT8GD0&location=2109))
