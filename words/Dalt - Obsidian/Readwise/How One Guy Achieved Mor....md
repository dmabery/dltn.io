1
- THE BACKGROUND OF SILK ROAD:
  • The anonymous marketplace operated between 2011 and 2013
  • It was Amazon for illegal goods - ranging from magic mushrooms to heroin to AK47's
  • It is estimated the website generated 600,000 Bitcoin in commission - $34 BILLION at today's prices https://t.co/HflfUckKIO ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521438175662083))
1
- The FBI + DEA's top priority was to: 
  1. Unmask the founder - Known by the pseudonym "Dread Pirate Roberts"
  2. Shut the website down 
  Despite their billions of dollars of resources, highly trained divisions, and decades of experience - they couldn't do it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521440843235336))
1
- FBI + DEA was outperformed by one guy *using Google in his spare time*.
  The point of this thread isn't to debate the ethics of drugs being illegal. 
  The point is to highlight the power of an individual with: 
  1. High agency 
  2. Internet connection
  3. Thinking outside the box ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521443326271488))

- INTRODUCING GARY ALFORD: 
  • Gary Alford was a tax inspector in New York City
  • When he started investigating the Silk Road, he had 0 knowledge of Bitcoin, Tor (Dark web) or online drugs
  • Gary was like Elon in electronic cars or space - he had 0 qualifications. https://t.co/zGopkwzKRD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521448413962243))
1
- Gary did have the following on his side: 
  1. Gary reads everything 3X: 
  • He reads every book, email or article 3 times
  • He is obsessed with retaining more info than those around him
  • Gary believed if he consumed everything at least three times, he would remember more ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521451849109506))
1
- 2. Gary's mental model: 
  • After reading the bitcoin whitepaper for the *3rd time*, he became obsessed with the "Gamblers Run Problem". 
  • No matter how much money you have in a betting scenario, the casino has infinite money, so if you continue playing - it will win. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521454277611521))
1
- • Gary believed the Dread Pirate Roberts was the gambler and he was the casino. 
  • If the Dread Pirate Roberts continued playing the game, Gary would eventually win. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521456508960768))
1
- 3. Gary's thinking outside the box
  • Gary was a student of history - his favorite case was The "Son of Sam". 
  • Son of Sam was a NY serial killer between 1976-1977. 
  • The NYPD threw unlimited resources and couldn't find him. 
  Until they began to think outside the box... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521458937491457))
1
- • Rather than search the crime scene for weapons, one officer started looking for parking tickets in the areas of the murder sprees
  • His logic: No serial killer would stop mid-way through to pay for parking
  • Bingo! The same Ford Galaxie had tickets for every murder night https://t.co/CYCLGevYA2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521464297783296))
1
- • When detectives went to the murderer's home - he admitted on the spot and said "What took you so long?" 
  • Gary's lesson from this story: 
  You could outperform more experienced people by looking at the problem differently
  • He applied this to the Silk Road case. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521468450172930))
1
- HOW GARY CAUGHT THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS: 
  • Gary was obsessed with the idea of a "digital parking ticket" that existed on the internet for Silk Road. 
  He worked from first principles on the following question: 
  • "What is the earliest post about Silk Road on the internet?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521470866063364))
1
- • Gary simply searched "silkroad .onion" and filtered by date within Google search settings
  • The oldest post he could find was on a bitcoin forum. 
  • "Has anyone seen Silk Road yet? It's kind of like an anonymous Amazon" - Altoid https://t.co/U423Kp4log ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521473747558403))
1
- • Gary contacted all forums that were associated with the "Altoid" handle. 
  • Most forums had fake emails in their database for the handle - except one... 
  • "RossUlbricht@gmail.com" was associated with the oldest Altoid account. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521477191102469))
1
- • Despite weeks of Gary telling the FBI + DEA that Ross was the Dread Pirate Roberts - they ignored him. 
  • They eventually came round to his opinion as the evidence became undeniable. 
  • This story is mindblowing... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521479632158721))
1
- • The point of this story isn't whether drugs should be illegal or Ross' sentence is justified
  • The point of this story is to highlight how an individual with:
  1. Internet connection
  2. High agency
  3. Out of the box thinking 
  Can outperform the world's biggest organisations ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1363521482341629959))

  1. Using a search engine effectively
  2. Thinking outside the box
  It's not easy. 
  But it is becoming more and more possible. 
  Ask Gary Alford.
