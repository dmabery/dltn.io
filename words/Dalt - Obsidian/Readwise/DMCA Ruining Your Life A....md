- Tier lists are FREE and a great way to have your community show their ass and argue over things like snacks, anime, restaurants, and whatever else you can think to rank! It's free and a great way to get the chat movin'.

- Wanna show off your Big Brain? Well, Words on Stream is 100% free, online, and easy to use. Connect your account and go to town with your chat! As long as you're connected, the chat doesn't need to have the game to play with you.

- This hilarious game of Telephone is one of my favorites!! Absolutely hilarious and FREE.99. A great community game that involves drawing and overwhelming debauchery.

- LOSE YOUR MARBLES!! This is a free game where people in chat race marbles down obstacle courses and can join using commands. Great game to vibe out, listen to (COPYRIGHT FREE) music, and talk.

- This is one of the funniest things I've done on my channel - a timed test of the USA map. Timed tests are hilarious and your community can do it on their end too (or not). 
  Check out my victory song after I finally got 100% ðŸ˜­

- Have you tried ChefSquad yet? The music BANGS and it's another free community game! The goal is to make dishes together (think Overcooked but the streamer is vocal about directions).
  I cried from laughter playing this game ðŸ¥´

- I did a stream once where my friends and I wrote songs/freestyled over beats! This is a fun activity and the chat LOVED it. As usual, I get all of my copyright free music from Epidemic Sound, which has a 30 day free trial.

- Not exactly free but, construct something on stream! I put cocktails together, gingerbread houses, snack mixes, etc. You can also do Legos and puzzles and anything else you like to do. You can talk while you construct or listen to music. It's nice ðŸ˜Œ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KiwiOnTheSticks/status/1480237063450546177))

- A lot of chats happen to love TESTS: love language tests, personality tests, kink tests... ðŸ‘€
  Find one you care about and share the link with the chat! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KiwiOnTheSticks/status/1480237974587678723))

- I love streams where we discuss fashion and such. Every year we rate Halloween costumes- but you can do this with literally everything! 
  Get some materials together, craft some applicable overlays and ask the chat what they think!
  Here's an overlay I made in Canva for this event

- I have a monthly event called Demo Day where we explore demos from the Nintendo Eshop. I started it because I didn't make enough money/have connections to get new games when I first started.
  Games can be pricey! Grab some demos and make it a thing!
  (Road96 has a great demo!)

- Read a book to the chat! I know, sounds strange but... add music or sound effects using @voicemod, draw some crappy pictures to accompany it, and BOOM. Entertainment. You could even make it a sub goal and you'll write a story about the chat! Get creative âœ¨ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KiwiOnTheSticks/status/1480246731031855108))

- OOP okay keep this in mind! WRITE THE STORY YALL

- CLEAN YOUR ROOM! Decorate something. Play an IRL card game with a friend on VC (I like For The Girls, What Do You Meme, etc). COOK! Get crafty. Discuss current events! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KiwiOnTheSticks/status/1480251533149233156))

- I'll add more as I think of them. Please add your ideas too! We can all help each other.
  As always, be careful with inviting randoms, be sure to have moderation measures in place, and flex your creativity. 
  DMCA does not have to be the end of your channel.
  Good luck out there! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KiwiOnTheSticks/status/1480252448971370504))

- I'm back! got a couple more to add and then I'm putting my phone down ðŸ˜­

- We discussed reading books on stream earlier and it was advised that you use public domain material. These lists seem to be useful but do your research if you go this route!
