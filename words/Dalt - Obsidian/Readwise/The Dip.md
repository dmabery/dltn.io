B - The Dip

1
- Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time. ([Location 42](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=42))
1
- Extraordinary benefits accrue to the tiny minority of people who are able to push just a tiny bit longer than most. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=46))
1
- Extraordinary benefits also accrue to the tiny majority with the guts to quit early and refocus their efforts on something new. ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=47))
1
- Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff. Have the guts to do one or the other. ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=50))
1
- It’s called Zipf’s law, and it applies to résumés and college application rates and best-selling records and everything in between. Winners win big because the marketplace loves a winner. ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=78))
1
- Scarcity makes being at the top worth something. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=103))
1
- The reason that big companies almost always fail when they try to enter new markets is their willingness to compromise. They figure that because they are big and powerful, they can settle, do less, stop improving something before it is truly remarkable. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=143))
1
- Just about everything you learned in school about life is wrong, but the wrongest thing might very well be this: Being well rounded is the secret to success. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=147))
1
- In a free market, we reward the exceptional. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=153))
1
- But if all you need to do to succeed is not quit, then why do organizations less motivated than yours succeed? Why do individuals less talented than you win? ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=165))
1
- It involves understanding the architecture of quitting, and, believe it or not, it means quitting a lot more than you do now. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=167))
1
- Strategic quitting is the secret of successful organizations. Reactive quitting and serial quitting are the bane of those that strive (and fail) to get what they want. And most people do just that. They quit when it’s painful and stick when they can’t be bothered to quit. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=168))
1
- CURVE 1: THE DIP Almost everything in life worth doing is controlled by the Dip. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=172))
1
- It’s easy to be a CEO. What’s hard is getting there. There’s a huge Dip along the way. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=194))
1
- Successful people don’t just ride out the Dip. They don’t just buckle down and survive it. No, they lean into the Dip. They push harder, changing the rules as they go. Just because you know you’re in the Dip doesn’t mean you have to live happily with it. Dips don’t last quite as long when you whittle at them. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=197))
1
- The Dip creates scarcity; scarcity creates value. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=220))
1
- If you find yourself facing either of these two curves, you need to quit. Not soon, but right now. The biggest obstacle to success in life, as far as I can tell, is our inability to quit these curves soon enough. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=222))
1
- In a competitive world, adversity is your ally. The harder it gets, the better chance you have of insulating yourself from the competition. If that adversity also causes you to quit, though, it’s all for nothing. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=253))
1
- In fact, every single function of an organization has a wind problem. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=265))
1
- The next time you’re tempted to vilify a particularly obnoxious customer or agency or search engine, realize that this failed interaction is the best thing that’s happened to you all day long. Without it, you’d be easily replaceable. The Dip is your very best friend. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=270))
1
- And yet the real success goes to those who obsess. The focus that leads you through the Dip to the other side is rewarded by a marketplace in search of the best in the world. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=285))
1
- A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy. Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=286))
1
- It’s human nature to quit when it hurts. But it’s that reflex that creates scarcity. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=307))
1
- Simple: If you can’t make it through the Dip, don’t start. If you can embrace that simple rule, you’ll be a lot choosier about which journeys you start. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=310))
1
- Seven Reasons You Might Fail to Become the Best in the World You run out of time (and quit). You run out of money (and quit). You get scared (and quit). You’re not serious about it (and quit). You lose interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre (and quit). You focus on the short term instead of the long (and quit when the short term gets too hard). ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=325))
1
- You pick the wrong thing at which to be the best in the world (because you don’t have the talent). ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=330))

- DISTRIBUTION DIP ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=386))
1
- The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices: Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=436))
1
- No, the opposite of quitting is rededication. The opposite of quitting is an invigorated new strategy designed to break the problem apart. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=508))
1
- Short-term pain has more impact on most people than long-term benefits do, which is why it’s so important for you to amplify the long-term benefits of not quitting. You need to remind yourself of life at the other end of the Dip because it’s easier to overcome the pain of yet another unsuccessful cold call if the reality of a successful sales career is more concrete. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=530))
1
- Winners understand that taking that pain now prevents a lot more pain later. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=544))
1
- Is the pain of the Dip worth the benefit of the light at the end of the tunnel? ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=546))
1
- If he leaves and joins another company, he gets to reinvent himself. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=578))
1
- Strategic quitting is a conscious decision you make based on the choices that are available to you. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=586))
1
- Failing happens when you give up, when there are no other options, or when you quit so often that you’ve used up all your time and resources. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=588))
1
- “Never quit something with great long-term potential just because you can’t deal with the stress of the moment.” Now that’s good advice. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=600))

- The same is true for an organization. You don’t define yourself by the tactics you use. Instead, your organization succeeds or fails in its efforts to reach its big goals. And the moment your tactics are no longer part of winning the Dip—the moment they are in a Cul-de-Sac—you are obligated to switch tactics at the same time you most definitely keep aiming for the bigger goal. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=664))
1
- Here’s an assignment for you: Write it down. Write down under what circumstances you’re willing to quit. And when. And then stick with ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=674))
1
- If quitting is going to be a strategic decision that enables you to make smart choices in the marketplace, then you should outline your quitting strategy before the discomfort sets in. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=680))
1
- If quitting in the face of the Dip is a bad idea, then quitting when you’re facing a Cul-de-Sac is a great idea. The hard part is having the perspective to see this when you’re in pain, or frustrated, or stuck. That’s why setting your limits before you start is so powerful. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=684))
1
- If you enter a market that’s too big or too loud for the amount of resources you have available, your message is going to get lost. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=692))
1
- launching a product into too big of a market has little effect. You can’t create pressure and you never reach the Dip. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=694))
1
- In order to get through that Dip, you’ll need to quit everything else. If it’s not going to put a dent in the world, quit. Right now. Quit and use that void to find the energy to assault the Dip that matters. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QCSA54&location=708))
