A - That Which Is Unique, Breaks

1
- So, gradually and inevitably, to-day, to-morrow, or the next day, there comes back the conviction that the monk was right after all, and that all depends on what is the philosophy of Light. Only what we might have discussed under the gas-lamp, we now must discuss in the dark. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7d0j820564yq00wtv5z14n))

- Something odd happened. I think today we do not know *how* to go about building a water fountain. What we know is how to build one thousand water fountains. But not how to build one. (I pray you understand that this is not a thought about water fountains.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7d3rav1h750ehpxbetw02e))

- he ability to mass-produce removes the opportunity for the great many to learn to produce at all. From such a thought, a future full of consumption-only hobbies might come as no surprise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7d6wv5tb6srfyn4z9afn6a))

- If you commoditize toys, you remove the toymaker. If you remove the toymaker, the toy is only an object of consumption. It ceases to be an object of wonder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7d76pkxjb7gt8szvwk40dr))

- Something worrisome: The more things become commodities, the more we start to treat places and people like commodities, too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt7d89qtzw94bs0x8s11pja2))
