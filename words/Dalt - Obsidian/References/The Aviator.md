Movie was okay. I like the sets and styling, but it kind of seemed all over the place. I guess that's what a biopic is, but most biopics I've seen have some sort of theme or event they focus on in the person's life. For some reason, this didn't seem to have that. Instead, it just kind of went all through his life, almost like a biography.

The story is tragic, for sure. At first, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s mantra of "...if you do everything, you'll win," comes to mind with how much of a perfectionist Hughes was with Hells Angels. But then that also seemed to be what caused the implosion from the inside out? Never being okay with what you have, and also just spending and spending and spending money.

Leo was great, of course, but not the best movie.
