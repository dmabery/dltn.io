- When you make good content, you'll blow up. It's not the algorithm, not the time you post, or anything else. It's making good content.
- The "algorithm" = the "audience"
- If someone reads the title, do they *have* to watch it. If they don't click on it, will they be thinking about what they're missing later that day?
- Title should segue into the content and represent the length of the content. "Huberman's nightly routine" on a 3 hour video doesn't add up, so CTR is going to be much lower
- The more extreme the opinion in the title and thumbnail, the higher the Click-Through Rate
- With autoplay, having captions and visually interesting information in the first five to ten seconds is even more important because on the homepage, someone might not even see the thumbnail.
	- It also needs to closely relate to the title and thumbnail. If your title is about better sleep, but the first ten seconds is about what you eat in the morning, people are going to click off. It has to line up.
- You don't have to try as hard in the second half of the video as you do the first. If they're watching 45 minutes in, they'll probably still be watching 1 hour and 15 minutes in.
- It might be better to upload a third or half of the videos you do now, but make them so freaking good that the algorithm *has* to promote it and have to find audiences for it.
- There's no such thing as a perfect video
- What was someone's experience with your last video? If they watched your last one, they're more likely to watch your next one.
- Subscribers don't matter, views don't matter, revenue doesn't matter. Everything you want as a creator comes from making the best videos possible. (And thumbnails.)
