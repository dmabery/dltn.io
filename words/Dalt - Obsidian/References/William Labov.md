After majoring in English and philosophy at Harvard, William Labov (pronounced /lɑbov/) worked in “the real world” for more than ten years, first at a series of writing-oriented jobs and then for the longest period of time as an industrial inkmaker at a small
company. These jobs, as he describes in an autobiographical essay, reinforced for him that working-class people “have a lot to say,” and that linguistics would be better served if it were based on what people actually say and were subjected to rigorous experimen-tal techniques. He attended graduate school at Columbia to study linguistics, where he wrote up his famous studies of language variation in Martha’s Vineyard and New York City. In the past four decades, he
has published well over one hundred articles and is currently finish-ing a three-volume work on processes of language change. He has publicly refuted the claim that he “founded” sociolinguistics, given earlier work like that of Swiss linguist Louis Gauchet. He explains that the field was not a “virgin field” but “more like an abandoned back yard, overgrown with various kind of tangled, sec-ondary scholarship” (1972, 260; qtd. in McMahon 1994, 232). Nonetheless, Labov has gone a long way to cleaning up the mess, and his work has shaped research in many areas of sociolinguistics for the past five decades.
