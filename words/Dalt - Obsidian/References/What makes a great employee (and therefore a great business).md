From [[Brad Jacobs]] on [[The Knowledge Project]]

> What changed as a result of what you’re doing that contributed to our profit? That either grew our revenue or took out cost, and therefore improved our margins, improved our return on capital”.

Great employees either grow the revenue for the company or take out cost, which improves the margin and helps improve the return on capital for the business, thereby giving the shareholders more money.

Similarly, he explained:

> **there’s only two things a manager manages: return on capital and return on time.**

A manager doesn't manage projects or people; they manage return on capital and return on time. Great managers get great returns on both of those things.
