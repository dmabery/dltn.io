#197 Michaeleen Doucleff: TEAM Parenting

It's surprising how often we give our kids orders: "Do this!" "Don't do that!" But if we want to raise resilient and independent kids, is this the right approach to be taking? Michaeleen Doucleff argues there's a better way, and in this conversation, she explains why and shares practical strategies for solving the parenting "crisis" in the modern world.

In this conversation, Doucleff reveals four parenting principles that will help foster resilience and independence in your kids while protecting and enhancing their emotional well-being. Shand and Doucleff discuss her observations on how different cultures approach parenting 
and how their practices can help alleviate the burdens we place on ourselves and our children. We also explore the role of technology and it's impact on our parenting and our children's development and maturity. 

This episode will challenge your modern assumptions about the best ways to parent your children.
