- Editing - "The editing process is the ability to go back and take a look at something you've already written and try **to hear it a little bit differently**."
	- [[Editing is forcing yourself to hear or see your work differently]]
- A page turner, in the classic sense, forces the reader to turn the page because they *have* to figure out what happens next. Towles explains [[Lee Childs]] writes page turners. His Jack Reacher novels, you have to know what the next scene is going to be or something.
  
  In a literary sense, a page turner is different. You have to create that sense of urgency without action by drawing the reader into get interested in the psychology of the character. This forces the reader to keep reading because they want to know what the character is reading and feeling, and what they're going to do next.
