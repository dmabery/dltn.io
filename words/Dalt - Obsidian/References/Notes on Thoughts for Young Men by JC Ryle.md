"Remember what I say: if you would cling to earthly pleasures--these are the things which murder souls," JC Ryle wrote. "There is no surer way to get a seared conscience and a hard heart towards the things of God, than to give way to the desires of the flesh and mind. It seems like nothing at first, but it tells in the long run."

Born in England in 1816, educated at both Eton and Oxford University, Ryle was an Anglican Bishop and pastor. He wrote [*Thoughts for Young Men*](https://www.preachtheword.com/bookstore/thoughts.pdf) because he noticed, as he writes in the introduction, that among the churches biggest "troublemakers" were the young men and that without strict discipleship, they would go the way of the world. So, he penned a short five chapter pamphlet that outlined the reasons for exhorting young men, the dangers young men face, general advice to young men, special rules for young men, and finally a conclusion.

The entire pamphlet is worth reading, but the fourth chapter, Special Rules for Young Men, is filled with practical advice for young men living their lives as a follower of Jesus. I particularly like the emphasis he puts on attending church every Sunday.

> I would not want to leave any false impression on your minds. Do not go away and say I told you that going to church made up the whole of Christianity. I will tell you no such thing. [Something a disproportionate amount of church-goers think is the case.] I have no wish to see you grow up formalists and Pharisees. If you think the mere carrying of your body to a certain building, at certain times, on a certain day in the week, will make you a Christian, and prepare you to meet God, I tell you flatly you are miserably deceived...[T]he practices of Christianity are not to be despised because they are not saviors. Gold is not food, you cannot eat it, but you would not say it is useless, and throw it away. Your soul's eternal wellbeing most certainly does not depend on the practices of Christianity, but it is certain that without them, as a general rule, your soul will not do well.

Here are some other brilliant things he wrote.

> Go and take your fill of earthly pleasures if you will--you will never find your heart satisfied with them. There will always be a voice within, crying, like the leech in Proverbs 30:15, "Give! Give!" There is an empty place there, which nothing but God can fill. You will find, as Solomon did by experience, that earthly pleasures are but a meaningless show--promising contentment but bringing a dissatisfaction of spirit--gold plated caskets, exquisite to look at on the outside, but full of ashes and corruption within. Be wise in your youth. Write the word "poison" on all earthly pleasures. The most lawful of them must be used in moderation. All of them are soul- destroying if you give them your heart. **Pleasure, must first have the guarantee that it is not sinful--then it is to be enjoyed in moderation.**

I've never thought about "pleasures" in the sense of *are they sinful or not?* But this is clearly a must-do for Ryle.

> Young men, "Flee from sexual immorality" (1 Corinthians 6:18) if you love life. "Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient" (Ephesians 5:6). Flee from the opportunity of it--from the company of those who might draw you into it--from the places where you might be tempted to do it. Read what our Lord says about it in Matthew 5:28, "I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart." Be like the holy servant Job: "I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl" (Job 31:1). Flee from talking about it. It is one of the things that ought not even be hinted about in conversation. You cannot even touch black grease without getting your hands dirty. Flee from the thoughts of it; resist them, destroy them, pray against them--make any sacrifice rather than give way to them. Imagination is the hotbed where this sin is too often hatched. **Guard your thoughts, and there will be little fear about your actions.**

"Guard your thoughts, and there will be little fear about your actions."

Beware of reaching for and attempting to attain success in the world:

> Young men, God does not show favoritism or respects the honors bestowed by men. He rewards no man's heritage, or wealth, or rank, or position. He does not see with man's eyes. The poorest saint that ever died in a ghetto is nobler in His sight than the richest sinner that ever died in a palace. God does not look at riches, titles, education, beauty, or anything of the kind. There is only one thing that God does look at, and that is the immortal soul. He measures all men by one standard, one measure, one test, one criterion, and that is the state of their souls.

All moral failures, great sins, and life destroying circumstances come little by little. We often wonder, "How could that person be so stupid! They just decided to wake up one day and ruin their marriage and family?" But they didn't wake up one day and decide to ruin their marriage and family. They woke up one day a year ago and looked at something they shouldn't have. And then six months ago they talked to a co-worker in an inappropriate manner, which led to inappropriate feelings. Moral failures seem to be easy to avoid because they are so big, but they're not big. They happen little by little.

> You can be sure that no wicked man ever meant to be so wicked at his first beginnings. But he began with allowing himself some little sins, and that led on to something greater, and that in time produced something greater still, and thus he became the miserable being that he now is. When Hazael heard from Elisha of the horrible acts that he would one day do, he said with astonishment, "How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?" (2 Kings 8:13). But he allowed sin to take root in his heart, and in the end he did them all.

> Young men, resist sin in its beginnings. They may look small and insignificant, but mind what I say, resist them, make no compromise, let no sin lodge quietly and undisturbed in your heart. There is nothing finer than the point of a needle, but when it has made a hole, it draws all the thread after it. Remember the Apostle's words, "A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough" (1 Corinthians 5:6).

Small sins lead to big sins:

> Many a young man could tell you with sorrow and shame, that he traces the ruin of all his worldly prospects to the point I speak of--to giving way to sin in its beginnings. He began habits of deception and dishonesty in little things, and they grew on him. Step by step, he has gone on from bad to worse, till he has done things that at one time he would have thought impossible till at last he has lost his standing, lost his character, lost his peace, and almost lost his soul. He allowed a gap in the wall of his conscience, because it seemed a little one, and once allowed, that gap grew larger every day, till in time the whole wall seemed to come down.

> Remember this especially in matters of truth and honesty. Be careful in even the least syllable spoken. "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much" (Luke 16:10). Whatever the world may like to think, there are no little sins. All great buildings are made up of little parts--the first stone is as important as any other. All habits are formed by a succession of little acts, and the first little act is of mighty consequence. The axe in the fable only begged the trees to let him have one little piece of wood to make a handle, and he would never trouble them any more. He got it, and then he soon cut them all down. The devil only wants to get the wedge of a little allowed sin into your heart, and you will soon be all his own. It is a wise saying, "There is nothing small between us and God, for God is an infinite God."

> First it startles him, then it becomes pleasing, then easy, then delightful, then frequent, then habitual, then a way of life! Then the man feels no guilt, then obstinate, then resolves never to repent, and then he is damned.

Then how do we avoid those outcomes?

> Young men, if you don't want to come to this, remember the rule I give you this day-- resolve at once to break off every known sin...Resolve, by God's help, to shun everything which may prove an occasion of sin.

It can be easy to focus on dealing with or attempting to irradiate the "big" sins in your life. But often, the small lies, the little deceptions, and the moments of pride, anger, and envy lead to the "big" sins. So, Ryle encourages to "break off every known sin." And not only that, but to "shun everything which may prove an occasion of sin." Don't open the websites that lead to temptation. Don't go to the bars or late night dinner with coworkers. Don't go near alcohol or restaurants if those settings "may prove an occasion of sin."

He continues:

> It is an excellent saying, "He that would be safe from the acts of evil, must widely avoid the occasions." There is an old fable, that the butterfly once asked the owl how she should deal with the fire, which had singed her wings; and the owl counseled her, in reply, not to even look at its smoke. **It is not enough that we determine not to commit sin, we must carefully keep at a distance from all approaches to it.** By this test we ought to examine the ways we spend our time--the books that we read, the friends that we visit, the part of society which we interact with. We must not be content with saying, "There is nothing wrong here;" we must go further, and say, "Is there anything here which may cause me to sin?"

"**It is not enough that we determine not to commit sin, we must carefully keep at a distance from all approaches to it.**"

We often think religious persecution isn't really something to worry about in 21st Century America. And in the traditional sense, it isn't. You needn't not worry for your life if you want to preach the gospel. But a form of religious persecution shows itself still in other ways. People don't quite understand why you don't go for drinks with the team every Friday night, or why you spend so much time volunteering at church, or why you give so much money away. These confusing actions can create conflict in others. Often, people will think you assume you're better than them and start to resent you. Or, they'll push you. "C'mon, going to the club isn't that bad. We're just gonna watch!" "The movie isn't that inappropriate."

This is Ryle's response:

> Young men, endeavor, as much as you can, to keep clear of everything which may prove injurious to your soul. People may say you are too conscientious, too particular, and ask where is the great harm of such and such things? But don't listen to them. It is dangerous to play tricks with sharp tools: it is far more dangerous to take liberties with your immortal soul. He that would be safe must not come near the brink of danger. **He must look on his heart as a barrel of gunpowder, and be cautious not to handle one spark of temptation more than he can help.**

The sin of sloth can lead to temptation and sin evermore. When you're bored, you're mind is looking for excitement. When you're home alone and have nothing to do, that's when the enemy strikes the most fervently. So be on guard. Stay busy. Adam was working in the garden before the fall, so we should be diligent with our hands and bodies and work hard, for idleness can destroy.

> This is one great reason why idleness is to be avoided. It is not that doing nothing is of itself so wicked; it is the opportunity it affords to evil and empty thoughts; it is the wide door it opens for Satan to throw in the seeds of bad things; it is this which is mainly to be feared. If David had not given opportunity to the devil, by walking on his house-top in Jerusalem with nothing to do, he probably never would have seen Bathsheba bathing, nor murdered her husband Uriah.

Remember, God is everywhere. So, act in such a way that shows reverence to His presence:

> Live as in the sight of God. This is what Abraham did, he walked before Him. This is what Enoch did, he walked with Him. This is what heaven itself will be, the eternal presence of God. Do nothing that you would not like God to see. Say nothing, you would not like God to hear. Write nothing, you would not like God to read. Go no place where you would not like God to find you. Read no book of which you would not like God to say, "Show it to Me." Never spend your time in such a way that you would not like to have God say, "What are you doing?"

And go to church regularly. Be in community.

> I dwell on this point, because Satan will try hard to fill your minds with arguments against the practices of Christianity. He will draw your attention to the numbers of persons who use them and are no better for the using. "See there," he will whisper, "do you not observe that those who go to church are no better than those who stay away?" But do not let this move you. It is never fair to argue against a thing because it is improperly used. It does not follow that the practices of Christianity can do no good because many do them and get no good from them. Medicine is not to be despised because many take it and do not recover their health. No man would think of giving up eating, and drinking because others choose to eat and drink improperly, and so make themselves sick. The value of the practices of Christianity, like other things, depends, in a great measure, on the manner and spirit in which we use them.
> 
> Let me name another point which is closely connected with this subject. Let nothing ever tempt you to become a Christian who does not make every effort to attend church on Sunday and make the day special to the Lord. Make up your mind to give all your Sundays to God. A spirit of disregard for this day is growing up among us with fearful rapidity, and not least among young men. Sunday vacations, Sunday visiting, Sunday excursions, to the exclusion of church attendance and honoring of the Lord, are becoming more common every year than they were, and are doing infinite harm to souls. 
> 
> Young men, be jealous on this point. Whether you live in the city or in the country, take up a decided line; resolve not to miss church on Sunday and the fellowship of God's people. Do not let the plausible argument of "needing to sleep-in to rest your body," do not let not the example of all those around you, do not let the invitation of companions pull you away from fellowship and worship; let none of these things move you to depart from this settled rule, that Sunday's are for God's honor and for fellowship with His people.
> 
> Young men, you may have friends who forget the honor of the Lord's day; but resolve, by God's help, that you will always remember to keep it special. Honor it by a regular attendance at some place where the gospel is preached. Settle down under a faithful ministry, and once settled, let your place in church never be empty. Believe me, you will find a special blessing following you: "If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD'S holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words, then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob" (Isaiah 58:13-14). And one thing is very certain, your feelings about Sunday and the fellowship will always be a test and criterion of your fitness for heaven. Fellowship and worship are a foretaste and a fragment of heaven. The man who finds them a burden and not a privilege, may be sure that his heart stands in need of a mighty change.

And don't forget to pray

> Young men, believe me, if your soul is to be saved, you must pray. God has no speechless children. **If you are to resist the world, the flesh, and the devil, you must pray: it is in vain to look for strength in the hour of trial, if it has not been sought for.** You may be thrown in with those who never do it, you may have to sleep in the same room with someone who never asks anything of God, still, mark my words, you must pray.

Temptations to sin will always come, and it can be discouraging when you feel like God is showing up to help deliver you. But I'd ask, is that the only time you cry out to God? "It is in vain to look for strength in the hour of trial, if it has not been sought for."

Just as one goes to the gym to get stronger, or practices golf on the range to get better when they play, a Christian must pray, pray, and pray to continue growing in the relationship in the Lord and grow in His Spirit for when evil comes, He is there to strike it down.
