Here are a few lessons about compound interest that were worth millions of dollars to me. I hope they help you, too We've all seen an example of investing money over decades to become a millionaire. It works, but it takes time -- like with my assumptions below, it takes 25 years to make your first million

But to make your second million, it takes less than 10 years

THIS IS AMAZING! As your portfolio gets bigger, it becomes unstoppable. (Feel free to adjust the numbers on any compound interest calculator.) Now let's talk about how to accelerate that growth. The most common response I get is, "Who wants to wait 40 years to have millions?" You don't have to wait. You can accelerate your growth by: - Finding a higher-paying job and/or negotiating your salary - Cutting costs and redirecting to investments - Starting a side business - Investing in other areas, such as real estate Here's what I did: - I set up an automatic investment plan that invested at least 20% of gross income - I created a business and kept an eye on profit - I created a rule that when I made unexpected income, I'd invest ~75% of it These dramatically accelerated the growth of my portfolio. You should find the rules that work for you, but no matter what, it pays to be patient and methodical with your money
