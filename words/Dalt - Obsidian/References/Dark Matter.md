Dark Matter on AppleTV was great. The first few episodes were phenomenal, the episodes in the middle were slow and repetitive, and I thought the finale was dumb (but many of my friends disagree with me on this). It felt like after all of the tension it was just, "And they lived happily ever after."

When Ryan got dropped off in new Chicago, and Amanda stayed in a world that looked awfully similar, I *knew* they'd find each other. I thought that they'd play a bigger role in rescuing Jason1 and his family, though; but their reunion was pretty much just set up for season two.

My biggest gripe with the finale is that we had a bunch of Jasons trying to kill the other Jasons because they wanted to be the ones to take the family, but then when Jason1 and family get to the box, they're surrounded by other Jasons who just let them through? Friends have simply explained they have a different countenance than the other Jasons, but idk, I'm not buying it.
