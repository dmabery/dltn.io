- How to manage the dual feed between public and private and if we can allow people to sign up directly on Spotify for the private one.
- What we can expect from the "back catalog" (over 90 days old) from an ad perspective.
	- Do we have to edit out old ads, or can we overlay them?
- What we can expect if we move the entire ads to dynamic including new episodes.Â 
	- Programatic and host-read ads. CPMs on each?
- What we can expect in term of promotion from you if we move over (specifics)
- How to put videos on Spotify
- How YT integration works
	- I don't think this is a thing; I think he thinks it's a thing.

Audiobook guests

2-3 guranteed per quarter

Specific ads for books/tours/ etc.


- Can do programmatic ads; no host-read ads.
- No YT integration
- Separate private feed, but the public users see them all still
- Waiting on information for CPM and specific promotion material
- Downside of putting video on is that the audio from the video gets taken out. Currently, the audio version is very stripped down and has the intro and outro. We could put those in the video, but then Shane would have to record intro/outro on video. Or, we do two video versions: one on Spotify and a separate one on YouTube.
