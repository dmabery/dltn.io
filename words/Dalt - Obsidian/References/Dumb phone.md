How to make your iPhone a dumbphone (without having to buy an e-ink phone): 1. Have a friend set up a screen time password you cannot access 2. Delete all social media or any distracting apps 3. Set time limits for popular social network websites 4. Turn off the app store so you can't redownload social apps (Using the web version of any social app sucks and will drive you insane, causing you to use it less) Congrats, you have a dumb phone You can turn it to grayscale, but I'm not convinced color is what makes your phone addicting. I tried this for a while, and it made it hard to use certain UIs because colors help you know what to click on I have a 5-minute timer on Twitter, and Safari Instagram is basically unusable. I am not distracted by my phone but can still have maps, podcasts, audiobooks, etc. (I wanted a flip phone, but I need maps and enjoy audiobooks when driving.)
