- [[Notes/Therories & Terms/Evergreen Notes]] turn a check of text into a memorable piece of information.
	- How can you take an idea you had or read and turn it into something you can remember?
- If you can build ideas into smaller pieces, then you can start to use those as building blocks for larger, more complex ideas that have a very stable foundation.
- [[Haruki Murakami]] wrote in [[What i Talk About When I Talk About Running]] - "Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional." #quotes 
	- What he means by that is, when you sign up for a marathon, it's obviously going to hurt. But you get to choose whether or not you're going to enjoy the pain and find the moments of greatness from it, or you're going to suffer through it all.
	- The same could be said about #death or #troubles. When you go through a hard thing, the pain of that thing is inevitable. It's going to hurt. But whether or not that hurt is prolonged and lasting and awful and you make it worse is up to you. You can find the #joy in those moments, as hard as it may be.
	- [[Pain is information]]
- [[The tools are irrelevant. What matters is the creation.]]
