- https://macwright.com/ - Simple, but long lasting. I like the casual-ness of this.
- https://paco.me/ - Very nice. Similar to https://www.ekzhang.com/.
- https://brandur.org/ - I love the blue. But has a bit too much going on for me.
- https://neil.computer/ - I *love* the Wikipedia like tables. Think I want to do that table style for my /about page. #blog-inspiration 
- https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/ - This is really cool. Micro posts while reading, basically. Similar to how i wanted to try /stream.
	- Here's a writeup of how he publishes that part of his site. Simple. Takes time. But something I should definitely try and do! https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/how-i-take-and-publish-notes/#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20git%2Dbacked,I%20take%20and%20publish%20notes.
	- He also has a more personal "CV" style site at  jim.nielsen.com - I can do the same if I wanted to, but right now I like having the blog and my CV in one page.
- https://benji.org/ - Simple; cool footnote

  * I should build a stream like that under my recent posts…also, I should create my tags page to list posts on the side bar and then scroll through them up top. I think that would be sick!!
