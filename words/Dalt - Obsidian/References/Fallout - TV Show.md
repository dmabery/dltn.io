I started watching Fallout two days ago and I just finished it. After a month (May '24) of intense travel and a busy work season, getting to veg out and watch an incredible TV show was the perfect way to spend the weekend.

I loved it.

There was just enough intrigue and story to keep me watching for eight hours, but not so much to where I was frustrated with the lack of background. It also didn't end every episode on a massive cliffhanger just to keep you watching, like other TV shows nowadays do.

The final episode left me with enough of a resolution to not feel frustrated, while also leaving open the chance to continue the story and find out more about what went on before the bombs dropped. It really makes me want to play the game (but I probably won't).
