In [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6N1F8NwrIuv2nEj71bLIAC?si=4c8cda73b22a4b7c), Jared Cohen, (someone who works at Goldman Sachs and somehow has time to write presidential biographies), explains what some of the presidents did after they left office.

He complains, slightly, that biographers don't do their subjects justice when, after they leave office, they go straight to their death. A lot of presidents, according to Cohen, did a lot of different things that are worth mentioning. Some of them, he claims, actually did more *after* they left office than when they were in office. As an example, he cites John Quincy Adams's nine terms in the US House of Representatives.

Imagine being president—holding the highest office one can achieve in the political realm—and then basically being demoted to serve *nine* terms in the House. That takes a level of humility most people who hold the Oval Office don't have. What's more interesting is that JQA wasn't just biding time checking boxes, he was fighting for abolition and accomplished a lot.

He's fascinated by George W. Bush's total abandonment of politics and ability to stay out of the limelight and pick up a paintbrush instead. He also covers William Howard Taft's "happiest years of his life" on the Supreme Court, a post which he held *after* the presidency. (The only person to lead both the Judicial and Executive branches of the government.)
