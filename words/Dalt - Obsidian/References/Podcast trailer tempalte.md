Here’s my formula: first, I review the podcast for one or two short but provocative comments made by my interviewee. Second, I record a voice over that follows these comments with a narrative that both explains the theme of the show but also alludes to more information that can only be learned by listening. Third, I mix this with royalty free, tension building music. This teaser becomes the introduction for each episode.

Because I promote these episodes on LinkedIn, I use Headliner.app to create an audiogram with the teaser intro I’ve created and episode-unique artwork. I upload these audiogram videos along with a short narrative with tags and user links.

It’s a lot of work but is effective. You can sample some of these intros by listening to just the first 2-4 minutes of any of my show’s episodes. The show is titled “Commercial Innovation for Defense” and can be found at all the usual podcast distribution services.
