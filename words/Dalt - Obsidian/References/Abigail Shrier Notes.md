"When your kid goes to therapy, it undermines your authority as a parent."


Over the last decade, therapy has become the de facto solution to solve all sorts of problems for all sorts of people. Everyone has slowly accepted the idea that therapy is normalâ€”and overall a net-benefit to society.

But instead of helping kids work through difficult circumstances, what if it's just making the problems worse? That's what Abigail Shrier thinks is happening, and in this conversation, she reveals some surprising reasons why.

Shane and Shrier discuss the real reason therapy is "bad," how we got to this point of acceptance as a culture, and what you can do as a parent to get back to normalcy. Shrier also shares her personal experiences with lifelong therapy patients, who should *actually* be in therapy, and the one thing that makes someone a successful parent.
