(I think is the optimal way)

- **Multi-color highlight** when reading cases. Allows easy **book briefing**. Early in the semester when I'm more ambitious / if I have time later in the semester, I'll go through and **actually brief my cases** .This too is 5x easier if you have color coded highlight system. Beyond that, I don't really take notes on readings _before_ class unless it's a reading that is explaining new concepts that I think will be tricky
    
- In class: **Hand write notes.** Keeps me engaged and focused, and that is a huge part of the battle. Phone off and in bag. If I'm pulling up the ebook on my computer, I use do not disturb and close the messages app. I just really like the engagement you get from hand writing notes.
    
- After class / end of week: **Type up my notes**. I type them all in one google doc per class. This allows easy searching. Use subheadings for each day. Try to format by topic within each day and clean up your hand written notes.
    
- End of month / end of unit: **Condense typed notes into outline**. Honestly, this is a lot of copy pasting. I read through my typed notes, find what is important, and copy it over to my outline. I do _a lot_ of formatting with my outline though to keep it organized and looking nice.
