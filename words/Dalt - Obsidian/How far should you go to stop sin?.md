Answer: As far as you need to.

It's often said that the Spirit doesn't want to change what you do, it wants to change what you *want* to do. While I agree with that statement—and think it's a good measure of sanctification—it can give people the wrong idea about the importance of protecting themselves from sin.

Rather than putting up practical roadblocks to stop sin, people hear that and convince themselves that a "real" Christian wouldn't even *want* to sin anyway, therefore, putting up practical roadblocks to stop sin is cheating the Spirit of doing the sanctifying work in their soul.

Instead of doing whatever they can to prevent themselves from sinning, they rely on their willpower, which is strong on the mountaintop and weak in the valley. (Or, they're simply afraid of the tension that arises in the body when the flesh *wants* to sin but the Spirit, acting through the body at a better time, has put up roadblocks to prevent such sin from happening. In other words, it allows them to continue to sin knowing they will be saved by Grace.)

Imagine two alcoholics—Fred and Jenny—who are both committed to quit drinking but are going about their journey in different ways.

Fred is convinced that he can deny alcohol through his willpower alone. He refuses to make changes to his everyday life, so he continues going to the bar with friends after work, but only a Coke for him. He doesn't want to waste the good wine and whiskey in his pantry, so he keeps it around for when friends come over and need a slight libation.

Jenny, on the other hand, knows she has absolutely no power over her drinking. She refuses to go to bars—even restaurants—because the sight of the alcohol hanging up and other people ordering drinks make her mouth water. She still eats out, but gets take out; if she can, she gets it delivered so she doesn't even need to go in the restaurant. She's dumped out all of her alcohol, with an accountability partner present, as a symbol of her turning away from temptation.

Who do you think will conquer the sin quicker?

There is nothing wrong with putting up restrictions that make it harder for you to sin. Block those websites. Delete those apps from your phone. Don't watch those types of movies. Don't hang out with those people.

This may lead to some inconveniences in life. If you get rid of social media because it's tempting and fills you with lust, yeah, you might miss out on some photos of friend's trips or cute pictures of their baby, but that's a small price to pay for eradicating sin from your life.

Don't be embarrassed for putting up road blocks to prevent you from sinning. Sin gets in the way of our relationship with God and hardens our heart. It would do well for us to do whatever we can to prevent any sin—no matter how big or small—from entering our lives if we can.

This isn't a step away from grace and towards works and the law, either. God's grace will be there to forgive you every time you fall. But as it says in 2 Peter, "Add to your faith, virtue," so we are to remove by our faith, sin.

God actually does this to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3. After they eat the fruit from the tree of good and evil, God comes into Eden and asks where they are. He sees their shame and immediately knows they ate from the tree. So, to prevent them also from eating fruit from the tree of life, he *removes* them from the garden. He's not "punishing" Adam and Eve, per se, but he is ensuring they can't sin against him again. Once evil entered the world, God knew the infallibility He would have to deal with, and he also knew Adam and Eve were not strong enough to resist the temptation to eat from the tree of life, so he made it impossible for them to do so.

As soon as sin enters the world, God ensures roadblocks are created that prevent more sin from happening.

And that is exactly what we should do today.
