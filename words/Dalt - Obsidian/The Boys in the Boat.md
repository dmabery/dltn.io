*Exactly* my type of movie! It's about a group of mostly poor college students from Washington University who learn to row crew, and, defying the odds, qualify for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin (!) and win gold!

First off, how *crazy* is it that the olympics were in Berlin in 1936. Seeing the flags strewn around Germany with swastikas must've been crazy. I thought there would be much more animosity between the teams, tourists, and such, but there wasn't much shown in the movie. (Maybe there was in real life, but they didn't feel like they could convey it well with limited time.) I guess in '36, things were still relatively calm, though the storm was brewing.

This movie reminded me of the benefit of standardized testing for colleges. When schools got rid of the testing, students who didn't have a lot of money or connections found it harder to get into schools, because their resumes and extracurricular activities weren't as good. But with standardized testing, if you study and get a high score, you're much more likely to be admitted into a selective school.

The regattas in the movie are kind of the same situation. There are no politics; if you beat the other schools and have the fastest times, you win. And if you win, you get to go to the Olympics. It's a good reminder that, although a lot of things are about who you know, some things aren't. Pure meritocracy doesn't exist as much as it used to, but there are some areas in life, especially sports, where it's still thriving. (Even though they did have to raise $5,000 to actually fund the trip to Berlin, and if they couldn't get the money, Cal or Penn would have gone in their stead.)

The craftsmanship George showed to the *Husky Clipper* was also touching. I think as the years go by, we get fewer craftsmanâ€”people who *really* care about doing a *good* job on their work. Though he really didn't get any credit for the win, the attention to detail he gave to the boat, like making sure to apply the right amounts of wax and ensure the hull is the right dimensions so the water splashes across it evenly, no doubt helped the team glide smoother and faster in the water. George also had the wisdom and sense to ask Joe to help him apply the last coat of wax just before he was quitting. He built that relationship up throughout the movie and when someone needed to save Joe from himself, George stepped in with just the right amount of tough love.

- Another way of saying you're a craftsman, or identifying craftsman, is to [observe where](https://x.com/_TamaraWinter/status/1813221352322503094) people have "unreasonable high standards" for things. Some people aren't craftsmen in their job, but are in their kitchen; aren't in the gym, but are when they swim. This may seem contradictory: well how an you be a craftsmen in one area but not another? Simple: there's only so much time in the day. I've written before about how I don't believe in the phrase, "how you do anything is how you do everything," because some things just need to be done. This is the same idea. You can't be a craftsman in ever area of your life, but most people can be in one or two areas of their lives, and those are the good friends and employees to have. If you ask someone that, and they don't have an answer, well, "that's revealing as well."
- Thinking about this some more, I wonder what the difference is between an artist, a craftsman, and an engineer? Or artist, craftsman, designer? Or artist, craftsman, architect?
	- Artist seems to be creating something that's beautiful, but doesn't have a lot of tangible value in the world. It doesn't do anything. They also seem to be wide-ranging. Can paint, take photos, etc. Things don't have to be perfect, because imperfections make the art unique. Details are important, but don't matter very much to the finished quality. It can be seven inches, or seven and a half inches. Artists work chaotically. They can work on a painting in one order, and do the same painting but change the order around. Tools don't matter as much for an artist. As they as they have something that will work, they make it work. Artists are chaotic in their organization. There might be some paint brushes in that drawer, or maybe try over in that jar. I think there's some more paint, but I don't remember where I put it.
	- Craftsman are usually highly specialized. They can make one or two things exceptionally well, and they take *a lot* of time. For a craftsman, perfectionism is something to strive for, and anything less than isn't good enough to ship. Details are the most important thing. The corner has to be cut at a 37 degree angle and it needs to be 4 1/8 inches wide. There are no degrees of perfection for a craftsman. It's either perfect, or it's not done. Craftsman are very orderly and follow a routine. If they make a chair, they follow the same exact steps every single time they make the chair. Tools are incredibly important to a craftsman. With the right tools, a complicated job because a bit simpler. If they don't have the right tool, they either get the right tool, or change their strategy to use what they have work, but they never use a tool that's not fit for their job. Craftsman are meticulous about their environment and workshop. Everything has a place. At the end of the day, the shop is cleaned, rags are hung to dry, and the sawdust is vacuumed or blown away.
		- That's all I can think of for now, but I think this is an interesting idea to chase down. I'll have to do some more research to see what other people say the differences are between these two archetypes.
