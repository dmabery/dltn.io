# Why I Don’t Workout in the Morning
I think I originally heard this idea from [Carey Nieuwhof](https://careynieuwhof.com/), and it went something like this: *If your best focus/work/productivity hours are in the morning, why are you wasting them doing something that’s essentially mindless*?

That’s an insane idea because every productivity influencer and cold-plunge participator espouses the gospel of “wake up, workout,” but I actually agree with Nieuwhof on this.

If you’re fresh and awake and ready to tackle the challenges and tasks you have before you right when you wake up, don’t waste those precious hours doing something you could do *almost* as effectively at 6:00pm. The morning hours are usually quiet because no one else is awake. And there’s also something romantic about cranking away at an important task as the some comes up. When I’m in this situations, I feel like me and the sun are just two dudes doing our jobs.

I used to workout in the morning. Because of the nature of my job, I didn’t really have any true deep work that needed to be done. I also loved how I felt after sweating through a long run or a workout–the rest of the day just seemed easier, so I did it.

But once I started law school, my routine radically changed for the first time in about four years. I suddenly had traffic to beat and a thirty minute commute ahead of me everyday. I worked out in the morning for the first week of school and hated it because I never felt like I had any “deep work” time throughout the day, so everything just felt like catch up. If I had an unexpected assignment due or needed to spend more time reading supplements on a confusing subject, I had to actively *find* that time, which was difficult. (I also didn’t like showering and getting ready at my school’s gym.)

So, that’s why I no longer work out in the morning. I’m able to get about four hours of work done in the two hours between 7:00 and 9:00am, and personally, focusing on my studies is the biggest priority for me. Thus, I use the most productive hours to work on the most important problems.

I’m not saying this is what you *should* do, I’m saying this is what I do.

Here are two reasons why you shouldn’t follow this advice, followed by one massive problem that I’m facing.

**Reason #1: Working out, losing weight, or getting healthy is your number one life priority right now.** If that’s the case, you should definitely work out in the morning.

**Reason #2: It’s virtually impossible for you to workout later in the day if you don’t get it in during the morning hours.**
