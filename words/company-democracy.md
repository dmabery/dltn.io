"Consensus is the enemy of scale."

That's a quote from Brian Halligan, co-founder and the former CEO of HubSpot. In a recent interview on The Knowledge Project podcast, he stressed the importance of rejecting the idea of having "consensus" when it comes to decisions about products, what to build, and how to run a company.

> I used to say, “Whenever we’re making an important decision, there should be winners in the room and losers. We shouldn’t find that negotiated settlement that everyone is happy with. Somebody should be unhappy, three or four people should walk out unhappy, and one should walk out happy, and we’re all going to be good with it.” As you get bigger, the gravity pulls you towards consensus, and I think consensus is the enemy of greatness.

When pressed for an example, he makes it tangible:

> Let’s just say it’s my call, which is rare. Two people in the room are saying black, and two people in the room are saying white. I think that the majority of CEOs are walking out of the room where the decision is gray.
> 
> [...]
> 
> The bigger you get, the worse that problem gets, and I always tried to walk out of the room saying, “We’re going to pick black or white. If you lose this decision, you might win the next one. Let’s not get all pissed off about it. We’ll all survive,” and I think that’s the right way to scale it.

When every decisions ends in consensus, instead of an opinionated product that does exactly what it should do, companies end up with a combination of half-baked features that sort of work together, but not really. I think this happens because when no one "loses," by nature, no one can "win." So there isn't anyone on the inside of the company championing a product or feature like they own it, because no one actually *owns* it.

This is why when it comes to making big decisions, companies also shouldn't rely on committees. When committees make decisions, no one can be held accountable. When no one is held accountable, no one feels the personal responsibility to make sure the decision is being made properly because if it ends up being a bad decision, everyone can just blame the committee—and it's hard to fire a committee.

Committees are great for providing different lenses into a situation, giving advice on personal areas of expertise, and eliminating blindspots for the decision-maker. But at the end of the day, one person needs to synthesize that advice and make the decision and be on the hook for the outcome of that decision.

President Harry Truman understood this idea. In a series of interviews with Merle Miller after his presidency, Truman spoke at-length about decision making and how he and his "successor"—Eisenhower—differed. Truman hated Eisenhower's reliance on his staff to help him make decisions while in office. "When Castro decided to go in the other direction for support, Eisenhower was probably still waiting for a goddamn _staff_ report on what to think," Truman said.

"As you may have observed," Miller writes, "Mr. Truman was often a profane, a mildly profane man to me anyway, but 'staff report' were the two dirtiest words he uttered in all our talks together."

Consensus, committees, and staff reports should not make decisions. Individual people should make decisions, and yes, there should be some losers and some winners.
