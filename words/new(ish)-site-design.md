# New(ish) site design

If you read my blog via dltn.io, you might’ve noticed my site is a bit darker.

Since I built my blog, I’ve almost exclusively had my site in “light mode”—there was an off-white background with close-to-black text. Every time I tried to build dark mode, I just didn’t think it looked very good.

Until now! The new background color is #191919 and the text color is a nice off-white, #FAFAFA.

I also changed my default typeface to Verdana. Ever since I first spun up the blog, I used Inter as the main typeface. I love Inter. Everyone loves Inter. Everyone *uses* Inter.

But I was ready for something new, and I was going back and forth between using three different serifs: [Crimson Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text), [Source Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4?query=source+serif), and [Newsreader](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader?query=newsreader). I liked the “classic” feel they added to my site, and out of the three, Crimson is probably my favorite. It’s a *really* good typeface for long body copy.

But the serif fonts made my site feel too serious. Reading shorter posts or simple ideas felt out of place on such an academic-feeling typeface.

While I was sorting through that debacle, I came across [~bt](https://btxx.org/). When I landed on the site, I *loved* how simple it was. Something about seeing Verdana on a dark site felt like it was a good blend between the classic and academic feel of a serif typeface and the playfulness of a typeface like Inter.

The typeface I use *probably* doesn’t matter for my career, but since I do want to write more about history, the law, and the history of the law, I felt like using a timeless and original typeface was a good decision.

Everything else about the site is virtually identical as before: same layout, same about page, same home page, etc. Although the layout and design is dead simple (thanks, [Steph](https://stephango.com/)), every time I’ve branched my repo to design something different, I always like it *less* than the current design. The posts are prominent on the home page, along with the topics I write about, and there are a few sentences about who I am. I think that’s the *perfect* home page for a personal blog. I’ve yet to see anything that I like better.

The lack of features and pages and styles makes it easy to resist fiddling with CSS and just lets me focus on reading and writing.
