Up until August, my reading schedule was normal. But once school hit, I was only able to finish two "fun" books throughout the entire semester. It's not that I didn't have the time to read fun books, but whenever I sat down to do so, there was a small voice inside my head that convinced me my time was better spent reading for school. I don't regret that, though. The rationale was that every hour spent studying should, hopefully, be worth it when the semester is over, and though reading fun books helps me learn, it's not as "productive" as being caught up on reading for school. Plus, spending a few hours reading for school helped me get ahead for the week, which allowed me to slow down and make sure I really understand the material, identify the areas I was confused, and come up with specific questions to ask my professors. I don't think I would have had that luxury if I was reading everyday for the following day.
