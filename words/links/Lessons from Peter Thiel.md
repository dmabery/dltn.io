When you have something that’s working, it’s almost always better to spend time making that thing work better—and make it work so it makes you more money—and not start something new.

>   At a micro level, an extra hour of focus on the current project has a much higher return than an hour on something new, or worse, 5 minutes each on 12 new things. Before you ever do something new, you should understand the opportunity cost vs. existing things. Don’t rationalize that something you want to do is complementary when it’s not!
