I have a new page on my site: dltn.io/links where I'll publish notes from (mostly) articles with brief editorial comments.

I stole this idea from Jim Nielsen after I came across his site: www.notes.jim-nielsen.com. I've long wondered how I can post quotes and ideas from articles that I read, publicly, but have never found something that really worked. After seeing how Jim made his site, reading the technicalities of how it works, and perusing his code, I decided to make my own page that does something similar.

I like [how he explains it](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/notes-dot-jim-nielsen-dot-com/):

> What makes those notes useful is 1) the process of internalizing their meaning through collecting, writing, and publishing them, and 2) the ability to reference them in the future.

Since I already publish my book notes at /notes, I had to think of a different nomenclature. During development, it was /quotes, and I liked that. But then I realized, as Jim also explains in his post, I'm not really collecting the quotes to have a list of cool quotes; I'm collecting them to consolidate my own insights and notes from what I read, publicly.

I saw someone else name theirs /links, and I liked that, because to a reader, ideally this is a place they can land and find unique reading material.

Since it's just one page (another thing Jim explains), search is as easy as CMND + F. That's great because I didn't want to build search, but knew it would be useful to have that functionality. Also, there are no tags or filter views in the usual sense of the term. I do add tags, but they're simply so I can CMND + F and search for "#reading."

There are two reasons I'm doing this:

1) It helps me learn and internalize the information better. Reading articles and highlighting stuff on Readwise is a passive behavior. Consolidating them and separating the wheat from the chaff is an active behavior; active behaviors are better for learning.
   
2) Blogs and personal sites are lighthouses to find and connect with like-minded people. Not in a echo chamber sort of way, but in a, "Hey, I read that article too. Here's what I learned," sort of way. Traditional blogging was *heavy* on the link posts with commentary, and as much as I want blogs like that to come back, I don't want to crowd my essays and "original" posts with these shorter "here's a good quote" post. Publishing at /links gives me the best of both world.

So: read, reply, and send me cool links!
