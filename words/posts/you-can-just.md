I hear a lot of peers say how they want to get into something new.

"Oh I want to run a marathon, but I just don't know how to start training. I never really ran before."

"I'd love to learn French, but I don't have any experience with learning a new language."

"Going to medical school is a dream, but I just don't know how to study for it."

"I've been meaning to find a new job, but that job market is brutal."

Every time I hear something like that from someone, I want to calmly reply, "You can just...do things."

You can just...

- Go to medical school
- Learn a new language
- Move to a new city
- Find a new job
- Start training for a marathon
- Become a body builder
- Learn how to cook
- Go camping

There are often no prerequisites required for leaving something behind and starting new but two: courage to take the first step and faith that it might all just be okay.

You can just...
