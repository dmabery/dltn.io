# Burden to Act and Res Ipsa Loquitur

When evaluating burden in a negligence action using Learned Hand’s formula to determine breach of duty: B < (P)(L), I was a little confused on how to actually evaluate breach.

Breach, basically, is how hard or burdensome it would have been for the defendant to have done something differently. So, if the plaintiff is alleging the defendant breached their duty by doing something unreasonable or negligent, the B in the formula evaluates how hard or easy it would have been for them not to do that thing. If the plaintiff is alleging the defendant breached their duty by not doing something, the B in the formula evaluates how hard it would have been for the defendant to do that thing.

If the Burden to do something was low, they didn’t do it, the probability of harm was high, and the magnitude of the likely harm was high, then they breached their duty. If the Burden to do something was high, they didn’t do it, the probability of harm was low, and the magnitude of the likely harm was also low, then they didn’t breach their duty.

If the Burden to not act was low, and they acted, and the probability of the harm was high and likely magnitude of the harm was high, then they breached their duty.

Res Ipsa Loquitur

The judge, just like in any case, is the gatekeeper to the jury of a res ipsa loquitur charge. If a judge determines that every element of res ipsa loquitur can be found by a reasonable jury, it gets sent to the jury and it will survive a motion to dismiss.

Once in front of a jury, the jury gets to decide whether or not it’s more likely than not that every element of res ipsa loquitur is found. If they decide that they are met, the jury may infer a breach of duty but they don’t have to. The only real reason they may find every element but not find breach of duty is because they were persuaded by the defendant’s acts proposed in evidence of reasonable conduct.

If the jury decides that one element, just one, of res ipsa loquitur was not met, then they cannot infer breach of duty, and likely, the case will be dismissed or found for the defendant. There can usually be no other unreasonable conduct on the part of the defendant because if there was, the jury would never have contemplated res ipsa loquitur in the first place.

Res Ipsa Loquitur and B < (P)(L)

Typically, you don’t need to use BPL when you analyze a set of facts based on res ipsa loquitur because the elements of RIL go to establish breach, and BPL is just another way to establish breach. If they are met, there is breach; if they aren’t met, there is no breach.
