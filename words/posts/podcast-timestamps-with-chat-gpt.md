One problem I run into a lot while producing *The Knowledge Project Podcast* is making timestamps for multiple versions of an episode.

For example, we have different videos that appear on Spotify and YouTube. The full-length interview is the same, but the YouTube version and Spotify version have different introductions; the Spotify version is much longer because there are ad reads and a longer guest bio.

This proved difficult to manage timestamps because once I had them for the YouTube version, I either had to re-watch the Spotify version for the adjusted times, or do some math in my head to calculate the difference in every timestamp.

But then I realized ChatGPT can help. So here's what I do.

1. I watch the YouTube version of the podcast to create the timestamps.
2. Then I note the difference in timestamps between when the full-length interview starts on both versions. For example, if the interview starts at 01:00 on YouTube and 03:15 on Spotify, the difference is 02:15.
3. I paste the YouTube timestamps into ChatGPT and ask it to add 02:15 to each timestamp and return it to me in the format that's suitable for Spotify: (00:00) Intro).
4. Sometimes I have to prompt it a few more times to get the format right, but the answer it gives are now the timestamps I use for the Spotify version of the podcast.

This seems dead simple—and it is,—but it's been really helpful for me, and when I was trying to figure out the quickest way to do this, I couldn't find much online, so I thought I'd share!
