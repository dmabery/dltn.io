# My blog’s identity crisis

Now that I have officially decided to keep my blog built with Next, I thought my blog tinkering time was over and I could just go back to sitting down and writing posts.

But then I realized I can still mess with the design...duh!

The blog has been pretty much this same design since its inception: white background, black text, using Inter. It’s clean, easy to read, and looks great on any device.

But it is a bit boring. I resonated with what [The Jelly Teapot wrote](https://thejollyteapot.com/2023/10/11/on-a-blogs-visual-identity) about a site’s visual identity:

> When I visit [certain] websites...I don’t need to read a single word, know the URL or the name of the site to know the one I am viewing. Same when I see the entries from Michael Tsai, Kev Quirk, or Quanta Magazine in my newsreader: they stand out in the feed and I know from which blog or website it’s from, as I recognise their icon.
> 
> I feel like my blog currently lacks this kind of visual identity. Its current icon — or rather its lack of an icon — feels a little like other feeds I am subscribed to, coming from Mastodon or Medium which all share the same favicon: generic, anonymous, and doesn’t stand out visually from the others.
> 
> Like I wrote in a previous post, There is no place like home: Why I love my blog, I know what makes my blog mine, what its identity is: bare-bones design, minimal style, tiny footprint, etc. But for the casual reader, for someone stumbling upon one of my posts, it can definitely feel a bit plain, boring, forgettable.

Might feels plain, boring, and forgettable. Like Magand’s though, that’s sort of the point? I like how easy everything is to read. But, still, I think I’m ready for something new.

I’ve tried using serif fonts in the past because since I write about history and books a lot, I wanted my site to feel more serious and studious. [Crimson](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text) is an amazing typeface for that vibe. But the result was almost too serious and studios; when I read shorter posts from the archive, it just felt out of place.

Here are some renditions I’ve been working on.

Here’s a futuristic space vibe, inspired by [Luke Harris’s site](https://www.lkhrs.com/). I love the colors and the typeface, but my wife and I both agree that it doesn’t fit the overall content of my site very much. I do like it, a lot though.

And light mode

I think I’m going to remove the entire list of tags and posts from the /index because there are just too many things to click on. I’ll just build out a separate /tags page. So I think I’ll stick with this layout, I just don’t know which vibe to go with.

Here are some serif options.

And, of course I had to see what the genius-professor-too-busy-to-write-CSS was like. (I actually really love it.)

I also tried a pure black background with Verdana. My reasoning with trying Verdana was that it’s so classic and timeless that it looks studios and serious, but it’s not *too* serious to be out of place on a personal blog.

Still, every time I’ve tried a new color scheme or layout in the past, I always end up liking it *less* than what I currently have. I don’t know if that’s because what I have is familiar, or what I have *actually* just works really well. (Either way, thanks, [Steph for the inspiration](https://stephango.com/).)

For now the designs will sit in limbo in a GitHub branch, maybe never seeing the light of day.
