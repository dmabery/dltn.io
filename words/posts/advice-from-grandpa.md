From [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1kg9L8tsQR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

1. Your terrible job is the dream of the unemployed.
2. Your house is the dream of the homeless.
3. Your health is the dream of the ill.

"Don't let difficult times make you forget your blessings." Be thankful for what you have.

(A tad cheesy, but that doesn't make it any less true!)
