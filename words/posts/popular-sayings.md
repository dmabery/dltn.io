I've always been curious where popular sayings come from. While they usually have an interesting origin story, most of them also have witty clap-backs.

Here are the second half of some popular sayings:

- Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.
- Great minds think alike, though fools seldom differ.
- For the love of money is the root of all evil. 

(Most people say "Money is the root of all evil." Money isn't evil. The love of money is evil.)
- An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
- Jack of all trades, master of none but better than a master of one.
- Birds of a feather flock together until the cat comes.
- The early bird catches the worm but the second mouse gets the cheese.

A lot of people hear these and wrongly assume these were the original and the second half got cut off sometime in the past. That's mostly wrong.

Instead, what probably happened was someone came up with a creative way to shut up the people who kept saying these quips to explain a point.

Naturally, they didn't catch on as well as the first half. But the idea that these are the "full" sayings is incorrect.
