At 20 years old, Ben Franklin realized most of his life up to that point had just kinda happened to him.

So, he wrote a personal handbook that would guide his every action. This put him on a launch pad to being a great businessman, politician, and more.

This is what it said:

1. Be frugal

> It is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time, till I have paid what I owe.

2. Always be truthful

> To endeavor to speak truth in every instance; to give nobody expectations that are not likely to be answered, but aim at sincerity in every word and action â€” the most amiable excellence in a rational being.

3. Work hard and be patient

> To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand, and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of growing suddenly rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty.

4. Forgive quickly and don't hold grudges

> I resolve to speak ill of no man whatever, not even in a matter of truth; but rather by some means excuse the faults I hear charged upon others, and upon proper occasions speak all the good I know of everybody.
